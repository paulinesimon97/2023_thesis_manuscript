	abstract = {Wavelet analysis can be used to measure the power spectrum of solar-wind ﬂuctuations along a line in any direction (θ, φ) with respect to the local mean magnetic ﬁeld B0. This technique is applied to study solar-wind turbulence in high-speed streams in the ecliptic plane near solar minimum using magnetic ﬁeld measurements with a cadence of eight vectors per second. The analysis of nine high-speed streams shows that the reduced spectrum of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (trace power) is approximately azimuthally symmetric about B0 in both the inertial range and dissipation range; in the inertial range the spectra are characterized by a power-law exponent that changes continuously from 1.6 ± 0.1 in the direction perpendicular to the mean ﬁeld to 2.0 ± 0.1 in the direction parallel to the mean ﬁeld. The large uncertainties suggest that the perpendicular power-law indices 3/2 and 5/3 are both consistent with the data. The results are similar to those found by Horbury et al. at high heliographic latitudes. Comparisons between solar-wind observations and the theories of strong incompressible MHD turbulence developed by Goldreich \& Sridhar and Boldyrev are not rigorously justiﬁed because these theories only apply to turbulence with vanishing cross-helicity although the normalized cross-helicity of solar-wind turbulence is not negligible. Assuming these theories can be generalized in such a way that the three-dimensional wavevector spectra have similar functional forms when the cross-helicity is nonzero, then for the interval of Ulysses data analyzed by Horbury et al. the ratio of the spectra perpendicular and parallel to B0 is more consistent with the Goldreich \& Sridhar scaling P⊥/P ∝ ν1/3 than with the Boldyrev scaling ν1/2. The analysis of high-speed streams in the ecliptic plane does not yield a reliable measurement of this scaling law. The transition from a turbulent MHDscale energy cascade to a kinetic Alfve´n wave (KAW) cascade occurs when k⊥ρi 1, which coincides with the spectral break. At slightly higher wavenumbers, in the dissipation range, there is a peak in the power ratio with P⊥/P 1. The decay of this peak may be caused by the damping of KAWs, which is predicted to occur near k⊥ρi 4.},

This paper provides an overview of our current understanding of how the corona is heated and how the solar wind is accelerated. Recent models of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence have progressed to the point of successfully predicting many observed properties of this complex, multi-scale system. However, it is not clear whether the heating in open-field regions comes mainly from the dissipation of turbulent fluctuations that are launched from the solar surface, or whether the chaotic ‘magnetic carpet’ in the low corona energizes the system via magnetic reconnection. To help pin down the physics, we also review some key observational results from ultraviolet spectroscopy of the collisionless outer corona.},

We performed modelling of proton acceleration, with the three-dimensional analytic model of stationary reconnection of Craig et al. providing the unperturbed background conditions. Perturbations of particle trajectories resulting from a turbulent magnetic field component were simulated using small-amplitude pitch-angle momentum scattering, enabling modelling of both small- and large-amplitude turbulence in a wide wavevector range. Within the approach, no second-order Fermi acceleration process is allowed. Comparison of the acceleration process in models involving particle trajectory perturbations with the unperturbed model reveals that the turbulence can substantially increase the acceleration efficiency, enabling much higher final particle energies and flat particle spectra.},

Our analysis is guided by a two-point exact law derived recently for this problem in which ﬂux, source, hybrid and mixed terms are present. The relative importance of each term is studied for different initial subsonic Mach numbers MS and different magnetic guide ﬁelds B0. The dominant contribution to the energy cascade rate comes from the compressible ﬂux, which depends weakly on the magnetic guide ﬁeld B0, unlike the other terms whose moduli increase signiﬁcantly with MS and B0. In particular, for strong B0 the source and hybrid terms are dominant at small scales with almost the same amplitude but with a different sign. A statistical analysis undertaken with an isotropic decomposition based on the SO(3) rotation group is shown to generate spurious results in the presence of B0, when compared with an axisymmetric decomposition better suited to the geometry of the problem. Our numerical results are compared with previous analyses made with in situ measurements in the solar wind and the terrestrial magnetosheath.},

Here, we go beyond that approximation to include plasma compressibility using a reduced form of a recently derived exact law for compressible, isothermal MHD turbulence. Using in-situ data from the THEMIS/ARTEMIS spacecraft in the fast and slow solar wind, we investigate in detail the role of the compressible ﬂuctuations in modifying the energy cascade rate with respect to the prediction of the incompressible MHD model. In particular, we found that the energy cascade rate: i) is ampliﬁed particularly in the slow solar wind; ii) exhibits weaker ﬂuctuations in spatial scales, which leads to a broader inertial range than the previous reported ones; iii) has a power law scaling with the turbulent Mach number; iv) has a lower level of spatial anisotropy. Other features of solar wind turbulence are discussed along with their comparison with previous studies that used incompressible or heuristic (non exact) compressible MHD models.},

	abstract = {Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) is a mono-ﬂuid approximation extending the validity domain of the ordinary MHD system to spatial scales down to a fraction of the ion skin depth or frequencies comparable to the ion gyrofrequency. In the paper by Galtier (2006 J. Plasma Physics), an incompressible limit of the HMHD system is used for developing a wave turbulence theory. Nevertheless, the possibility and the consequences of such an approximation are different in HMHD and in MHD. Here, we analyse these differences by investigating the properties of the HMHD equations in the incompressible limit: the existence of linear modes, their dispersion relations and polarizations. We discuss the possibility of replacing the ﬂuid closure equation of a complete HMHD system by an incompressibility hypothesis and determine the validity range.},

A multi-spacecraft technique is used to compute the velocity and magnetic gradients, and then all the correlation functions involved in the exact relation. It is shown that when the density fluctuations are relatively small, \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{C\}{\textbar}\$ identifies well with its incompressible analogue \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{I\}{\textbar}\$ at MHD scales but becomes much larger than \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{I\}{\textbar}\$ at sub-ion scales. For larger density fluctuations, \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{C\}{\textbar}\$ is larger than \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{I\}{\textbar}\$ at every scale with a value significantly higher than for smaller density fluctuations. Our study reveals also that for both small and large density fluctuations, the non-flux terms remain always negligible with respect to the flux terms and that the major contribution to \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_{\textbackslash}text\{C\}{\textbar}\$ at sub-ion scales comes from the compressible Hall flux.},

	abstract = {In this work, we generalise linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability theory to include equilibrium pressure anisotropy in the fluid part of the analysis. A novel ‘single-adiabatic’ (SA) fluid closure is presented which is complementary to the usual ‘double-adiabatic’ (CGL) model and has the advantage of naturally reproducing exactly the MHD spectrum in the isotropic limit. As with MHD and CGL, the SA model neglects the anisotropic perturbed pressure and thus loses non-local fast-particle stabilisation present in the kinetic approach. Another interesting aspect of this new approach is that the stabilising terms appear naturally as separate viscous corrections leaving the isotropic SA closure unchanged. After verifying the self-consistency of the SA model, we re-derive the projected linear MHD set of equations required for stability analysis of tokamaks in the MISHKA code. The cylindrical wave equation is derived analytically as done previously in the spectral theory of MHD and clear predictions are made for the modification to fast-magnetosonic and slow ion sound speeds due to equilibrium anisotropy.},

Compressible and incompressible versions of the Karman-Howarth-Monin (KHM) and low-pass filtering/coarse-graining approaches are compared. In the simulation the total energy is well conserved; the scale dependent KHM and coarse-grained energy equations are also well conserved; the two approaches show similar results, the system does not have an inertial range for the cascade of kinetic energy, the region where this cascade dominates also have a non-negligible contribution of the kinetic-energy decay, dissipation, and pressure-dilatation effects. While the two approaches give semi-quantitatively similar results for the kinetic energy cascade, dissipation and pressure-dilatation rates, they differ in the increment separation and filtering scales; these scales are not simply related. The two approaches may be used to find the inertial range and to determine the cascade/dissipation rate of the kinetic energy.},

This occurs in such a manner as to reinforce the dominance of the outward-propagating ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd no evidence of a signiﬁcant anisotropy in the back-transfer dynamics and conclude that the process must be short-lived in order to be consistent with solar wind observations.

The Hall contribution of this law is tested and compared to other exact laws derived by Galtier and Banerjee \& Galtier using direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional electron MHD turbulence with a moderate mean magnetic ﬁeld. We show that the studied laws are equivalent in the inertial range, thereby offering several choices on the formulation to use depending on the needs. The expressions that depend explicitly on a mean (guide) ﬁeld may lead to residual errors in estimating the energy cascade rate; however, we demonstrate that this guide ﬁeld can be removed from these laws after mathematical manipulation. Therefore, it is recommended to use an expression independent of the mean guide ﬁeld to analyze numerical or in situ spacecraft data.},

The data span ﬁve decades in scales from the inertial range to the electron Larmor radius. In contrast to the inertial range, there is a successive increase toward isotropy between parallel and transverse power at scales below the ion Larmor radius, with isotropy being achieved at the electron Larmor radius. In the context of wave-mediated theories of turbulence, we show that this enhancement in magnetic ﬂuctuations parallel to the local mean background ﬁeld is qualitatively consistent with the magnetic compressibility signature of kinetic Alfve´n wave solutions of the linearized Vlasov equation. More generally, we discuss how these results may arise naturally due to the prominent role of the Hall term at sub-ion Larmor scales. Furthermore, computing higher-order statistics, we show that the full statistical signature of the ﬂuctuations at scales below the ion Larmor radius is that of a single isotropic globally scale-invariant process distinct from the anisotropic statistics of the inertial range.},

This complexity is due to different reasons such as the confinement of the magnetosheath plasma between two dynamical boundaries, namely the bow shock and the magnetopause; the high variability of the SW pressure that “shakes” and compresses continuously the magnetosheath plasma; and the presence of large-density fluctuations and temperature anisotropies that generate various instabilities and plasma modes. In this paper, we will review some results that we have obtained in recent years on plasma turbulence in the SW and the magnetosheath, both at the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the sub-ion (kinetic) scales, using the state-of-the-art theoretical models and in situ spacecraft observations. We will focus on three major features of the plasma turbulence, namely its nature and scaling laws, the role of small-scale coherent structures in plasma heating, and the role of density fluctuations in enhancing the turbulent energy cascade rate. The latter is estimated using (analytical) exact laws derived for compressible MHD theories applied to in situ observations from the Cluster and Themis spacecraft. Finally, we will discuss some current trends in space plasmas turbulence research and future space missions dedicated to this topic that are currently being prepared within the community.},

	abstract = {Compressible hydrodynamic turbulence is studied under the assumption of a polytropic closure. Following Kolmogorov, we derive an exact relation for some two-point correlation functions in the asymptotic limit of a high Reynolds number. The inertial range is characterized by: (i) a ﬂux term implying in particular the enthalpy; and (ii) a purely compressible term S which may act as a source or a sink for the mean energy transfer rate. At subsonic scales, we predict dimensionally that the isotropic k−5/3 energy spectrum for the density-weighted velocity ﬁeld (ρ1/3v), previously obtained for isothermal turbulence, is modiﬁed by a polytropic contribution, whereas at supersonic scales S may impose another scaling depending on the polytropic index. In both cases, it is shown that the ﬂuctuating sound speed is a key ingredient for understanding polytropic compressible turbulence.},

	abstract = {The ﬂuctuating magnetic helicity is considered an important parameter in diagnosing the characteristic modes of solar wind turbulence. Among them is the Alfve´n-cyclotron wave, which is probably responsible for the solar wind plasma heating, but has not yet been identiﬁed from the magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence. Here, we present the possible signatures of Alfve´n-cyclotron waves in the distribution of magnetic helicity as a function of θVB, which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and local mean magnetic ﬁeld. We use magnetic ﬁeld data from the STEREO spacecraft to calculate the θVB distribution of the normalized reduced ﬂuctuating magnetic helicity σm. We ﬁnd a dominant negative σm for 1 s {\textless} p {\textless} 4 s (p is time period) and for θVB {\textless} 30◦ in the solar wind outward magnetic sector, and a dominant positive σm for 0.4 s {\textless} p {\textless} 4 s and for θVB {\textgreater} 150◦ in the solar wind inward magnetic sector. These features of σm appearing around the Doppler-shifted ion-cyclotron frequencies may be consistent with the existence of Alfve´n-cyclotron waves among the outward propagating ﬂuctuations. Moreover, right-handed polarized waves at larger propagation angles, which might be kinetic Alfve´n waves or whistler waves, have also been identiﬁed on the basis of the σm features in the angular range 40◦ {\textless} θVB {\textless} 140◦. Our ﬁndings suggest that Alfve´n-cyclotron waves (together with other wave modes) play a prominent role in turbulence cascading and plasma heating of the solar wind.},

SWEAP’s electron Parker Solar Probe Analyzer (SPAN-E) instruments are a pair of top-hat electrostatic analyzers on PSP that are capable of measuring the electron distribution function in the solar wind from 2 eV to 30 keV. For the ﬁrst time, in-situ measurements of thermal electrons provided by SPAN-E will help reveal the heating and acceleration mechanisms driving the evolution of the solar wind at the points of acceleration and heating, closer than ever before to the Sun.

	abstract = {We present numerical simulations of decaying hydrodynamic turbulence initially driven by solenoidal (divergence-free) and compressive (curl-free) driving. Most previous numerical studies for decaying turbulence assume an isothermal equation of state (EOS). Here we use a polytropic EOS, P ∝ ργ, with polytropic γ ranging from 0.7 to 5/3. We mainly aim at determining the eﬀects of polytropic γ and driving schemes on the decay law of turbulence energy, E ∝ t−α. We additionally study probability density function (PDF) of gas density and skewness of the distribution in polytropic turbulence driven by compressive driving. Our ﬁndings are as follows. First of all, we ﬁnd that even if polytropic γ does not strongly change scaling relation of the decay law, the driving schemes weakly change the relation; in our all simulations, turbulence decays with α ≈ 1, but compressive driving yields smaller α than solenoidal driving at the same sonic Mach number. Second, we calculate compressive and solenoidal velocity components separately and compare their decay rates in turbulence initially driven by compressive driving. We ﬁnd that the former decays much faster so that it ends up having a smaller fraction than the latter. Third, the density PDF of compressively driven turbulence with polytropic γ {\textgreater} 1 deviates from log-normal distribution: it has a power-law tail at low density as in the case of solenoidally driven turbulence. However, as it decays, the density PDF becomes approximately log-normal. We discuss why decay rates of compressive and solenoidal velocity components are diﬀerent in compressively driven turbulence and astrophysical implication of our ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {In this review we will focus on a topic of fundamental importance for both astrophysics and plasma physics, namely the occurrence of large-amplitude low-frequency fluctuations of the fields that describe the plasma state. This subject will be treated within the context of the expanding solar wind and the most meaningful advances in this research field will be reported emphasizing the results obtained in the past decade or so. As a matter of fact, Helios inner heliosphere and Ulysses’ high latitude observations, recent multi-spacecrafts measurements in the solar wind (Cluster four satellites) and new numerical approaches to the problem, based on the dynamics of complex systems, brought new important insights which helped to better understand how turbulent fluctuations behave in the solar wind. In particular, numerical simulations within the realm of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence theory unraveled what kind of physical mechanisms are at the basis of turbulence generation and energy transfer across the spectral domain of the fluctuations. In other words, the advances reached in these past years in the investigation of solar wind turbulence now offer a rather complete picture of the phenomenological aspect of the problem to be tentatively presented in a rather organic way.},

	abstract = {The anisotropy of solar wind turbulence is a critical issue in understanding the physics of energy transfer between scales and energy conversion between ﬁelds and particles in the heliosphere. Using the measurement of Parker Solar Probe (PSP ), we present an observation of the anisotropy at kinetic scales in the slow, Alfv´enic, solar wind in the inner heliosphere. A steepened transition range is found between the inertial and kinetic ranges at all the directions with respect to the local background magnetic ﬁeld direction. The anisotropy of k⊥ k is found evident in both transition and kinetic ranges, with the power anisotropy P⊥/P {\textgreater} 10 in the kinetic range leading over that in the transition range and being stronger than that at 1 au. The spectral index varies from αt = −5.7 ± 1.3 to αt⊥ = −3.7 ± 0.3 in the transition range and αk = −2.9 ± 0.2 to αk⊥ = −2.57 ± 0.07 in the kinetic range. The corresponding wavevector anisotropy has the scaling of k ∼ k⊥2/3 in the transition range, and changes to k ∼ k⊥1/3 in the kinetic range, consistent with the kinetic Alfv´enic turbulence at sub-ion scales.},

A statistical survey of the data revealed a turbulent energy cascade over a range of two decades of scales that is broader than the previous estimates made from an exact incompressible law. A term-by-term analysis of the compressible model reveals new insight into the role played by the compressible fluctuations in the energy cascade. The compressible fluctuations are shown to amplify by two to four times the turbulent cascade rate with respect to the incompressible model in of the analyzed samples. This new estimated cascade rate is shown to provide the adequate energy dissipation required to account for the local heating of the non-adiabatic solar wind.},

Of the possible open systems, it is those endowed with many degrees of freedom and strongly deviating from equilibrium that are most challenging. A simple but very significant example of such a system is given by developed turbulence in a continuous medium, where we can discern astonishing features of universality. This two-volume monograph deals with the theory of turbulence viewed as a general physical phenomenon. In addition to vortex hydrodynamic turbulence, it considers various cases of wave turbulence in plasmas, magnets, atmosphere, ocean and space. A sound basis for discussion is provided by the concept of cascade turbulence with relay energy transfer over different scales and modes. We shall show how the initial cascade hypothesis turns into an elegant theory yielding the Kolmogorov spectra of turbulence as exact solutions. We shall describe the further development of the theory discussing stability prob­ lems and modes of Kolmogorov spectra formation, as well as their matching with sources and sinks. This volume is dedicated to developed wave turbulence in different media.},

	abstract = {Solar Probe Plus (SPP) will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. SPP’s main science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The SPP mission was confirmed in March 2014 and is under development as a part of NASA’s Living with a Star (LWS) Program. SPP is scheduled for launch in mid-2018, and will perform 24 orbits over a 7-year nominal mission duration. Seven Venus gravity assists gradually reduce SPP’s perihelion from 35 solar radii (\$R\_\{S\}\$) for the first orbit to \$\{{\textless}\}10{\textasciitilde}R\_\{S\}\$for the final three orbits. In this paper we present the science, mission concept and the baseline vehicle for SPP, and examine how the mission will address the key science questions},

	abstract = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation on Solar Probe Plus is a four sensor instrument suite that provides complete measurements of the electrons and ionized helium and hydrogen that constitute the bulk of solar wind and coronal plasma. SWEAP consists of the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) and the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN). SPC is a Faraday Cup that looks directly at the Sun and measures ion and electron fluxes and flow angles as a function of energy. SPAN consists of an ion and electron electrostatic analyzer (ESA) on the ram side of SPP (SPAN-A) and an electron ESA on the anti-ram side (SPAN-B). The SPAN-A ion ESA has a time of flight section that enables it to sort particles by their mass/charge ratio, permitting differentiation of ion species. SPAN-A and -B are rotated relative to one another so their broad fields of view combine like the seams on a baseball to view the entire sky except for the region obscured by the heat shield and covered by SPC. Observations by SPC and SPAN produce the combined field of view and measurement capabilities required to fulfill the science objectives of SWEAP and Solar Probe Plus. SWEAP measurements, in concert with magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and white light contextual imaging will enable discovery and understanding of solar wind acceleration and formation, coronal and solar wind heating, and particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere of the solar system. SPC and SPAN are managed by the SWEAP Electronics Module (SWEM), which distributes power, formats onboard data products, and serves as a single electrical interface to the spacecraft. SWEAP data products include ion and electron velocity distribution functions with high energy and angular resolution. Full resolution data are stored within the SWEM, enabling high resolution observations of structures such as shocks, reconnection events, and other transient structures to be selected for download after the fact. This paper describes the implementation of the SWEAP Investigation, the driving requirements for the suite, expected performance of the instruments, and planned data products, as of mission preliminary design review.},

bow shock is obtained, making use of magnetic field and plasma
observations provided by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)
over 600 orbits. In particular, the energy cascade rate is computed for
events with and without proton cyclotron wave (PCW) activity, for time
intervals when MAVEN was in the solar wind with no magnetic connection
to the bow shock. It is shown that the nonlinear cascade of energy at
the MHD scales is slightly amplified when PCWs are present in the
plasma, around the Martian perihelion. In addition, the analysis of the
normalized cross helicity and residual energy for the turbulent
fluctuations shows the presence of Alfvénic and
non-Alfvénic fluctuations in a magnetic dominant regime for the

use a set of four series of data, one observed and three surrogate, and
their PDFs and moments  (q⩽4)  as discriminating statistics. We show
that the technique allows for detecting coherent structures and
estimating their scales. We show furthermore that the phases, but not
the amplitudes, create the non-Gaussian tails of the PDFs. We show also
that the surrogate data used cannot account for asymmetries of the PDFs
of the observed data. This enables us to confirm a scenario of turbulent
cascade of mirror structures proposed in previous publications, by
showing the existence of an approximately constant energy flux in the

	abstract = {The solar wind shows periods of highly Alfvénic activity, where velocity fluctuations and magnetic fluctuations are aligned or
antialigned with each other. It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field fluctuations observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first encounter are mostly highly
Alfvénic. However, quantitative measures of Alfvénicity
are needed to understand how the characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low latitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify the extent of Alfvénicity—the Alfvén ratio
rA, the normalized cross helicity σc, the
normalized residual energy σr, and the cosine of angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations \${\textbackslash}cos \{{\textbackslash}theta \}\_\{\{vb\}\}\$ . We show that despite the overall impression that the Alfvénicity is large in the solar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the cross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These length scales (often {\textgreater}1000dI) are well
inside inertial range, and therefore, the suppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed to kinetic physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by large scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some cases, despite the cross helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the residual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range. These results suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify
Alfvénicity.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed guide to advanced collisionless fluid models that incorporate kinetic effects into the fluid framework, and that are much closer to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional magnetohydrodynamics. Such fluid models are directly applicable to modelling the turbulent evolution of a vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters. The text can be viewed as a detailed guide to Landau fluid models and it is divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non-Landau fluid) closures. Part 2 is dedicated to Landau fluid closures. Here in Part 1, we discuss the fluid model of Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) in great detail, together with fluid models that contain dispersive effects introduced by the Hall term and by the finite Larmor radius corrections to the pressure tensor. We consider dispersive effects introduced by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. We investigate the parallel and oblique firehose instability, and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these instabilities. Furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the fourth-moment level by prescribing a specific form for the distribution function. For the bi-Maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the ‘normal’ closure. We also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. Finally, by considering one-dimensional Maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments, we show that such fluid models are always unstable. The last possible non Landau fluid closure is therefore the ‘normal’ closure, and beyond the fourth-order moment, Landau fluid closures are required.},

The theory allows for the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the turbulent motion when there is no externally imposed electric or magnetic field. Various double and triple correlation tensors involving the components of the velocity and the magnetic field intensity are defined, and three equations governing the scalars defining these tensors are derived; these latter equations admit integrals of Loitsiansky’s type. The equations governing the dissipation of energy by viscosity and conductivity are also derived; they exhibit the manner in which energy is exchanged between the velocity and the magnetic fields. Finally, the equations appropriate for the case, when an external agency supplies kinetic energy to the system at a constant rate and a stationary condition prevails, are obtained; they suggest that the energy in the magnetic field is contained, principally, in the eddies with large wave numbers.},

Although recent observations gave evidence of the dominance of kinetic Alfve´n waves (KAWs) at sub-ion scales with ω {\textless} ωci, other studies suggest that the KAW mode cannot carry the turbulence cascade down to electron scales and that the whistler mode (i.e., ω {\textgreater} ωci) is more relevant. Here, we study key properties of the short-wavelength plasma modes under limited, but realistic, SW conditions, typically βi βe ∼ 1 and for high oblique angles of propagation 80◦ ΘkB {\textless} 90◦ as observed from the Cluster spacecraft data. The linear properties of the plasma modes under these conditions are poorly known, which contrasts with the well-documented cold plasma limit and/or moderate oblique angles of propagation (ΘkB {\textless} 80◦). Based on linear solutions of the Vlasov kinetic theory, we discuss the relevance of each plasma mode (fast, Bernstein, KAW, whistler) in carrying the energy cascade down to electron scales. We show, in particular, that the shear Alfve´n mode (known in the magnetohydrodynamic limit) extends at scales kρi 1 to frequencies either larger or smaller than ωci, depending on the anisotropy k /k⊥. This extension into small scales is more readily called whistler (ω {\textgreater} ωci) or KAW (ω {\textless} ωci), although the mode is essentially the same. This contrasts with the well-accepted idea that the whistler branch always develops as a continuation at high frequencies of the fast magnetosonic mode. We show, furthermore, that the whistler branch is more damped than the KAW one, which makes the latter the more relevant candidate to carry the energy cascade down to electron scales. We discuss how these new ﬁndings may facilitate resolution of the controversy concerning the nature of the small-scale turbulence, and we discuss the implications for present and future spacecraft wave measurements in the SW.},

Particular attention is paid to the use of structure functions in computing energy cascade rates and their general agreement with the measured thermal proton heating. We then examine the use of 1 h data samples that are comparable in length to the correlation length for the fluctuations to obtain insights into local inertial range dynamics and find evidence for intermittency in the computed energy cascade rates. When the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy, there is evidence of anti-correlation in the cascade of energy associated with the outward- and inward-propagating components that we can only partially explain.},

In particular, a system of generalized transport equations is presented that can be applied to widely different plasma flow conditions. The generalized transport equations can describe subsonic and supersonic flows, collision-dominated and collisionless flows, plasma flows in rapidly changing magnetic field configurations, multicomponent plasma flows with large temperature differences between the interacting species and plasma flows that contain anisotropic temperature distributions. In addition, if Maxwell’s equations of electricity and magnetism are added to the system of transport equations, they can be used to model electrostatic shocks, double layers, and magnetic merging processes. These transport equations also contain terms which act to regulate both the heat flow and temperature anisotropy, processes which appear to be operating in the solar wind. Also, we show that with the appropriate assumptions, the system of generalized transport equations reduces to each of the other major systems of transport equations for anisotropic plasmas that have been derived to date.},

	abstract = {We derive two new forms of the K´arm´an-Howarth-Monin equation for decaying compressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We test them on results of a weakly-compressible, twodimensional, moderate-Reynolds-number Hall MHD simulation and compare them with an isotropic spectral transfer (ST) equation. The KHM and ST equations are automatically satisﬁed during the whole simulation owing to the periodic boundary conditions and have complementary cumulative behavior. They are used here to analyze the onset of turbulence and its properties when it is fully developed. These approaches give equivalent results characterizing: the decay of the kinetic + magnetic energy at large scales, the MHD and Hall cross-scale energy transfer/cascade, the pressure dilatation, and the dissipation. The Hall cascade appears when the MHD one brings the energy close to the ion inertial range and is related to the formation of reconnecting current sheets. At later times, the pressure-dilation energy-exchange rate oscillates around zero with no net eﬀect on the cross-scale energy transfer when averaged over a period of its oscillations. A reduced one-dimensional analysis suggests that all three methods may be useful to estimate the energy cascade rate from in situ observations.},

By measuring the ﬁve-point second-order structure functions of the magnetic ﬁeld, we have for the ﬁrst time quantiﬁed the three-dimensional anisotropies and scalings at sub-ion scales ({\textless}100 km). In the local reference frame (Lˆ{\textasciicircum}, lˆ{\textasciicircum}, lˆ) deﬁned with respect to local mean magnetic ﬁeld B0, the “statistical eddies” are found to be mostly elongated along B0 and shortened in the direction perpendicular to both B0 and local ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. From several di (ion inertial length) toward ∼0.05 di, the ratio between eddies’ parallel and perpendicular lengths features a trend of rise then fall, whereas the anisotropy in the perpendicular plane appears scale-invariant. Speciﬁcally, the anisotropy relations for the total magnetic ﬁeld at 0.1–1.0 di are obtained as l  2.44 · l{\textasciicircum}0.71, and L{\textasciicircum}  1.58 · l{\textasciicircum}1.08, respectively. Our results provide new observational evidence to compare with phenomenological models and numerical simulations, which may help to better understand the nature of kinetic-scale turbulence.},

Using high-resolution, multispacecraft measurements of three intervals in Earth's magnetosheath from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic, Hall, electron pressure, and electron inertia terms from Ohm's law, as well as the impact of a finite electron mass, on the turbulent E spectrum are examined observationally for the first time. The magnetohydrodynamic, Hall, and electron pressure terms are the dominant contributions to E over the accessible length scales, which extend to scales smaller than the electron gyroradius at the greatest extent, with the Hall and electron pressure terms dominating at sub-ion scales. The strength of the nonideal electron pressure contribution is stronger than expected from linear kinetic Alfvén waves and a partial antialignment with the Hall electric field is present, linked to the relative importance of electron diamagnetic currents in the turbulence. The relative contribution of linear and nonlinear electric fields scale with the turbulent fluctuation amplitude, with nonlinear contributions playing the dominant role in shaping E for the intervals examined in this study. Overall, the sum of the Ohm's law terms and measured E agree to within ∼20\% across the observable scales. These results both confirm general expectations about the behavior of E in turbulent plasmas and highlight features that should be explored further theoretically.},

Major obstacles exist in formulating algorithms using the Galerkin method. In spite of the presence of aliasing errors, the pseudospectral method can be used to write algorithms that conserve a number of important global quantities. Accordingly, we suggest pseudospectral forms for a polytropic MHD model. Finally, a pseudospectral algorithm for the ideal gas MHD model is suggested. This algorithm conserves energy in terms of the dynamical fluid variables and not, as is common practice, due to a separate energy equation written in conservative form.},

In particular, we study spectra, intermittency and the third-order moment scaling, as well as the distribution of a local energy transfer rate proxy. The analysis is performed using the Magnetospheric Multiscale data from a single satellite that crosses longitudinally the KHI. Two sets of regions, one set containing predominantly magnetosheath plasma and the other containing predominantly magnetospheric plasma, are analysed separately, thus allowing us to explore turbulence properties in two portions of very different plasma samples. Results show that the dynamics in the two regions is different, with the boundary layer plasma presenting a shallower spectra and larger energy transfer rate, indicating an early stage of turbulence. In both regions, the effect of the KHI is evidenced.},

Such a coarse-graining method is already known in the literature as Favre filtering; however its use has been primarily motivated by appealing modeling properties rather than underlying physical considerations. We also prove that kinetic energy injection can be localized to the largest scales by proper stirring, and argue that stirring with an external acceleration field rather than a body force would yield a longer inertial range in simulations. We then discuss the special case of buoyancy-driven flows subject to a spatially-uniform gravitational field. We conclude that a range of scales can exist over which the mean kinetic energy budget is dominated by inertial processes and is immune from contributions due to molecular viscosity and external stirring.},

In particular, our results preclude transfer of kinetic energy from large-scales directly to dissipation scales, such as into shocks, in the limit of high Reynolds number turbulence as is commonly believed. The results hold in broad generality, at any Mach number, for any equation of state, and without the requirement of homogeneity or isotropy. The assumptions we make in our proofs on the scaling of velocity, pressure, and density structure functions are weak and enjoy compelling empirical support. Under a stronger assumption on pressure dilatation co-spectrum, we show that {\textbackslash}emph\{mean\} kinetic and internal energy budgets statistically decouple beyond a transitional "conversion" range. Our analysis demonstrates the existence of an ensuing inertial scale-range over which mean SGS kinetic energy flux becomes constant, independent of scale. Over this inertial range, mean kinetic energy cascades locally and in a conservative fashion, despite not being an invariant.},

	abstract = {We investigate the scale-locality of subgrid-scale (SGS) energy flux and interband energy transfers defined by the sharp spectral filter. We show by rigorous bounds, physical arguments, and numerical simulations that the spectral SGS flux is dominated by local triadic interactions in an extended turbulent inertial range. Interband energy transfers are also shown to be dominated by local triads if the spectral bands have constant width on a logarithmic scale. We disprove in particular an alternative picture of “local transfer by nonlocal triads,” with the advecting wavenumber mode at the energy peak. Although such triads have the largest transfer rates of all individual wavenumber triads, we show rigorously that, due to their restricted number, they make an asymptotically negligible contribution to energy flux and log-banded energy transfers at high wavenumbers in the inertial range. We show that it is only the aggregate effect of a geometrically increasing number of local wavenumber triads which can sustain an energy cascade to small scales. Furthermore, nonlocal triads are argued to contribute even less to the space-average energy flux than is implied by our rigorous bounds, because of additional cancellations from scale-decorrelation effects. We can thus recover the −4/3 scaling of nonlocal contributions to spectral energy flux predicted by Kraichnan’s abridged Lagrangian-history direct-interaction approximation and test-field model closures. We support our results with numerical data from a 51235123{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}msup{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}512{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}3{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} pseudospectral simulation of isotropic turbulence with phase-shift dealiasing. We also discuss a rigorous counterexample of Eyink [Physica D 78, 222 (1994)], which showed that nonlocal wavenumber triads may dominate in the sharp spectral flux (but not in the SGS energy flux for graded filters). We show that this mathematical counterexample fails to satisfy reasonable physical requirements for a turbulent velocity field, which are employed in our proof of scale locality. We conclude that the sharp spectral filter has a firm theoretical basis for use in large-eddy simulation modeling of turbulent flows.},

Strain generation by pressure and density gradients, both barotropic and baroclinic, also results from our analysis. These two processes underlie the recently identified mechanism of \&ldquo;baropycnal work\&rdquo;, which can transfer energy across scales in variable density flows. As such, baropycnal work is markedly distinct from pressure-dilatation into which the former is implicitly lumped in Large Eddy Simulations. We provide numerical evidence from 1024     3     direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulence.

We investigate the question: “At what scales does the mechanism of pressure-dilatation operate?” and present the first direct evidence that mean kinetic energy cascades conservatively beyond a transitional “conversion” scale range despite not being an invariant of the dynamics. We use high-resolution 10243 subsonic and transonic simulations. The key quantity we measure is the pressure-dilatation cospectrum, EPD(k), where we show that it decays at a rate faster than k−1 in wavenumber in at least the subsonic and transonic regimes. This is sufficient to imply that mean pressure-dilatation acts primarily at large scales and that kinetic and internal energy budgets statistically decouple beyond a transitional scale range. However, we observe that small-scale dynamics remains highly compressible locally in space and that the statistical decoupling in the energy budgets is unrelated to the existence of a subsonic scale range. Our results suggest that an extension of Kolmogorov's inertial-range theory to compressible turbulence is possible.},

The large-scale MHD fields are treated as the reproducible background flow, which is usually assumed to be time-independent or even previously given. The small-scale MHD fields are treated as irreproducible and turbulent fields, which vary randomly in space and time. The nonlinear interactions between different small fields are described by using a Kolmogorov type dimensional analysis. Concerning interactions between small-scale and large-scale fields, only the interactions between large-scale field and the ensemble averages over small-scale fields are considered in these theories (see Section 9). As Roberts and Goldstein (1991) and Zhou and Matthaeus (1990a) pointed out, the major problem with this two-scale separation is that these scale-separated theories disregard the subset of intermediate meso-scale fluctuations and interactions between them. This cannot describe the real solar wind, because the observed power spectra indicate a continuum of fluctuations with no clear dividing line between scales. Futhermore the theoretical models cannot describe the nonlinear interactions completely. For example they cannot describe nonlinear interactions that are non-local in wavenumber space, especially between the large-scale and the small-scale fluctuations, or nonlinear interactions being of anisotropic nature. One important way to deal with these difficult problems is MHD numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {In many periods the fluctuations of the magnetic vector δB and the flow velocity δV have been found to be (anti) correlated for Box {\textless} 0 (Box {\textgreater} 0) (Belcher and Davis, 1971; Denskat et al., 1981; Denskat and Neubauer, 1982; Marsch and Tu, 1990a; Tu et al., 1989b; Tu and Marsch, 1990a). The natural conclusion is that they are outward propagating Alfvén waves (Belcher and Davis, 1971). If they were a kind of convective structures with such a δB and δV correlation, how could we understand the systematic changes of the polarity of the correlation at magnetic sector boundaries? This argument was already given by Belcher and Davis (1971), however their wave examples observed near 1 AU were not pure Alfvén waves because the magnetic fluctuation energy is dominant. They interpreted this magnetic dominance as an effect of a large anisotropy in the pressure. This requires that 4π (p II — p ⊥)/ B 0 2 be as large as 0.4. However, the overall plasma anisotropy observed by Helios is very small (Marsch and Richter, 1984a) and cannot cause an Alfvén wave with magnetic energy dominance.},

This nonadiabaticity becomes clearly apparent by investigating the proton magnetic moment T ¥/B, which should be conserved in a collisionless double-adiabatic plasma. However, it is found observationally that T ¥/B increases with increasing heliocentric distance. These results are interpreted as evidence that solar wind protons in high-speed streams are heated between 0.3 and 1 AU. Yet, the heat source remains to be determined.},

Elsässer variables has been introduced in the data analysis and revolutionized our understanding of this subject. By their means the morphology of the e ± spectra and of σc and r A has been clearly established. (2) Some observational evidences have been found that show the existence in the solar wind fluctuations of nonlinear turbulence interactions. Among them are the incompressible convective structures or two-dimensional turbulence, and probably inward propagating Alfvén waves, in addition to the outward propagating Alfvén waves observed previously. (3) The dispute about the origin of predominantly outward propagating Alfvén waves in the solar wind has been settled, and the Sun is again believed to be the major source of the fluctuations. (4) The wave description and the turbulence description have been combined together to develop a unified picture and phenomenological theory, a WKB-like turbulence theory, to describe the turbulent nature of the Alfvénic fluctuations.},

Collisionless effects may be important in radiatively inefﬁcient accretion ﬂows, such as near the black hole in the Galactic center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modiﬁed to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A ﬂuid closure approximation is used to calculate heat conduction along magnetic ﬁeld lines. The anisotropic pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular momentum in accretion ﬂows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses). We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ‘‘collision’’ rate in a collisionless plasma and lead to more MHD-like dynamics. We ﬁnd that the MRI leads to efﬁcient growth of the magnetic ﬁeld in a collisionless plasma, with saturation amplitudes comparable to those in MHD. In the saturated state, the anisotropic stress is comparable to the Maxwell stress, implying that the rate of angular momentum transport may be moderately enhanced in a collisionless plasma.},

Models of pickup proton heating predict a monotonic temperature rise beyond about 30 AU but do not account for the smaller scale (few AU) temperature variations. At 1 AU, the solar wind temperature is a strong function of the solar wind speed. We find that incorporating a temperature dependence on speed into the pickup proton heating results can reproduce much of the smaller-scale temperature variation observed out to 68 AU. The same speed-temperature dependence provides good fits to data from both the outer heliosphere and from near Earth. Since a large fraction of the proton energy results from heating, this work implies that the heating rate is a function of the speed.},

	abstract = {The solar wind in the outer heliosphere is fundamentally different from that in the inner heliosphere, with the influence from the local interstellar medium becoming significant. Observational evidence of pickup ions has accumulated as Voyager 2 continues its journey to the interstellar medium. Specifically, the nonadiabatic solar wind proton temperature profile, the slowdown of the solar wind, and an increased pressure associated with pickup ions are the manifestations of pickup ions in the outer heliosphere. In order to understand the solar wind in the outer heliosphere, we extend the three-fluid model first proposed by Isenberg [1986] to include the energy sharing between the solar wind protons and pickup ions. For simplicity, we introduce a parameter, the energy partition ratio ε, to represent the division of the total energy provided by the pickup process between the solar wind protons and pickup ions. We find that only a small percentage of this total thermal energy is needed to heat the solar wind proton to produce the observed temperature profile. As expected, the higher the interstellar neutral hydrogen density, the smaller the percentage. The energy partition ratio has little effect on the slowdown of the solar wind and the pickup ion density distribution in the outer heliosphere, which is primarily controlled by the interstellar neutral hydrogen density. As far as the slowdown is concerned, a neutral hydrogen density of nH∞ = 0.08 cm−3 at the termination shock gives the best match to the observations [Wang et al., 2000]. In this case, the pickup ion density at 40 AU is also of the order of that estimated by Burlaga et al. [1996], and the energy partition ratio ε = 0.05 gives the best fit to the observed proton temperature profile.},

In this paper we examine the characteristics of MHD waves, fire-hose and mirror instabilities in anisotropic homogeneous magnetized plasmas. The model equations are a set of gyrotropic MHD equations closed by the generalized Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) laws with two polytropic exponents representing various thermodynamic conditions. Both ions and electrons are allowed to have separate plasma beta, pressure anisotropy and energy equations. The properties of linear MHD waves and instability criteria are examined and numerical examples for the nonlinear evolutions of slow waves, fire-hose and mirror instabilities are shown. One significant result is that slow waves may develop not only mirror instability but also a new type of compressible fire-hose instability. Their corresponding nonlinear structures thus may exhibit anticorrelated density and magnetic field perturbations, a property used for identifying slow and mirror mode structures in the space plasma environment. The conditions for nonlinear saturation of both fire-hose and mirror instabilities are examined.},

	abstract = {In a homogeneous anisotropic plasma the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shear Alfvén wave may become unstable for p∥ {\textgreater} p⊥ + B2/μo. Recently, a new type of fire-hose instability was found by Hellinger and Matsumoto [2000] that has maximum growth rate occurring for oblique propagation and may grow faster than the Alfvén mode. This new mode is compressional and may be more efficient at destroying pressure anisotropy than the standard fire hose. This paper examines the fire-hose type (p∥ {\textgreater} p⊥) instabilities based on the linear and nonlinear double-polytropic MHD theory. It is shown that there exist two types of MHD fire-hose instabilities, and with suitable choice of polytropic exponents the linear instability criteria become the same as those based on the Vlasov theory in the hydromagnetic limit. Moreover, the properties of the nonlinear MHD fire-hose instabilities are found to have great similarities with those obtained from the kinetic theory and hybrid simulations. In particular, the classical fire-hose instability evolves toward the linear fire-hose stability threshold, while the nonlinear marginal stability associated with the new fire hose is well below the condition of β∥ - β⊥ = 2 but complies with less stringent linear stability threshold for compressible Alfvén waves.},

Proton evaporation is explicitly taken into account along with momentum and energy gains due to friction with escaping protons. This model is investigated numerically by an iteration technique, assuming a lateral expansion of the solar wind. It is found that for very low temperatures, proton acceleration is caused mainly by a lack of fast-particle collisions and that the collisional population is more accelerated and denser at higher temperatures. The results also show that evaporation over a large extent of height reduces the solar-wind heating requirements to the region of the low corona. Examination of the physical stability of the solar-wind plasma in this model indicates that no electrostatic two-stream instability can arise, the firehose-instability condition could be satisfied only with very low temperatures near the level of full evaporation, and a point of serious instability with respect to magnetosonic whistlers occurs at a heliocentric distance of about 10 solar radii.},

Effects of large scale firehose-type instability are avoided or diminished by sizable internal magnetic fields, a dense cocoon increasing in pressure with distance from the beam, or linking a large, dense cocoon to the beam. Exponential growth is stopped when radial displacement is greater than one, shifting growth to longer wavelengths, and when the beam boundary sidewise velocity exceeds the sound speed. Bow shocks can yield hot spots where beam sidewise amplitude is largest, providing particle reacceleration, and sinusoidal nodes may account for regular hot spot formation by sidewise moving shocks. Curved beams are also investigated and are less stable due to the difficulty of retaining a dense cocoon downwind from the intracluster pressure. Explosive expansion of the beam may be due to an onset of local heating, and a nonlinear stage of instability may be linked to particle reacceleration due to the range of phenomena that the simple sidewise instability produces.},

The inclusion of heat fluxes leads to the presence of two new wave modes, in addition to the Alfven, slow magnetosonic and fast magnetosonic modes. The presence of the zeroth-order heat fluxes also results m an asymmetry in the wave speed and a new MHD instability. The new unstable wave propagates in the direction of the heat fluxes. It is demonstrated that the Alfvén wave and the associated fire-hose instability are not affected by the presence of heat fluxes, while the exclusion of heat fluxes may suppress the development of the mirror instability.

This paper presents a practicable method for ascertaining the instability of such plasmas in a uniform steady magnetic field with respect to disturbances propagating along the direction of that field. The method is applied to two examples of plasmas having anisotropic pressure, that is, having the pressure p‖ along the steady magnetic field not equal to the pressure p⊥ perpendicular to the field. The examples given are those of an electron plasma (with fixed neutralizing background) and of a plasma with two species having equal masses and opposite but equally large charges. The latter example is treated because it is mathematically simpler than an electron-ion plasma, and is referred to as an “electron-positron” plasma. In both examples when p⊥ {\textgreater} p‖ unstable electromagnetic type waves occur for all values of the dc magnetic field strength. When p⊥ {\textgreater} p‖ a new family of unstable hydromagnetic waves is found in the “electron-positron” plasma. Steady waves with frequency Ω(p⊥ − p‖)p⊥, where Ω is the electron gyrofrequency, are found in both examples for p⊥ {\textgreater} p‖. When p‖ {\textgreater} p⊥, classical results for the “hose” instability are recovered and are extended outside the guiding center limit in the case of the plasma with two oppositely charged species. The electron gas with fixed neutralizing background is found to be stable for p‖ {\textgreater} p⊥. Most of the results are found to be applicable to real (electron-ion) plasmas. Growth rates of unstable waves are treated in some detail.},

These equations differ from the CGL-MHD fluid model (single fluid equations by Chew, Goldberger, and Low, 1956) by including two anisotropic heat flux evolution equations, where the fluxes invalidate the double polytropic CGL laws. We derived the general dispersion relation for linear compressible wave modes. Besides the classic incompressible fire hose modes there appear four types of compressible wave modes: two fast and slow mirror modes - strongly modified compared to the CGL model - and two thermal modes. In the presence of initial heat fluxes along the magnetic field the wave properties become different for the waves running forward and backward with respect to the magnetic field. The well known discrepancies between the results of the CGL-MHD fluid model and the kinetic theory are now removed: i) The mirror slow mode instability criterion is now the same as that in the kinetic theory. ii) Similarly, in kinetic studies there appear two kinds of fire hose instabilities - incompressible and compressible ones. These two instabilities can arise for the same plasma parameters, and the instability of the new compressible oblique fire hose modes can become dominant. The compressible fire hose instability is the result of the resonance coupling of three retrograde modes - two thermal modes and a fast mirror mode. The results can be applied to the theory of solar and stellar coronal and wind models.},

Thus no higher moment terms appear in the third moment equations. The two third moment equations, which are obtained in a simple form, join other lower moment equations to form a closed set of moment equations. The new equations can be used to study the thermal anisotropy and the heat flux of the solar-wind proton.

In the sub-ion range the cascade continues via the Hall term, but the dynamic law derived in the framework of incompressible Hall-MHD equations is obtained only in a low plasma beta simulation. For a higher beta plasma the cascade rate decreases in the sub-ion range and the change becomes more pronounced as the plasma beta increases. This break in the cascade flux can be ascribed to nonthermal (kinetic) features or to others terms in the dynamical equation that are not included in the Hall-MHD incompressible approximation.},

	abstract = {The large-scale structure of many turbulent ﬂows encountered in practical situations such as aeronautics, industry, meteorology is nowadays successfully computed using the Kolmogorov–Kármán–Howarth energy cascade picture. This theory appears increasingly inaccurate when going down the energy cascade that terminates through intermittent spots of energy dissipation, at variance with the assumed homogeneity. This is problematic for the modelling of all processes that depend on small scales of turbulence, such as combustion instabilities or droplet atomization in industrial burners or cloud formation. This paper explores a paradigm shift where the homogeneity hypothesis is replaced by the assumption that turbulence contains singularities, as suggested by Onsager. This paradigm leads to a weak formulation of the Kolmogorov–Kármán–Howarth–Monin equation (WKHE) that allows taking into account explicitly the presence of singularities and their impact on the energy transfer and dissipation. It provides a local in scale, space and time description of energy transfers and dissipation, valid for any inhomogeneous, anisotropic ﬂow, under any type of boundary conditions. The goal of this article is to discuss WKHE as a tool to get a new description of energy cascades and dissipation that goes beyond Kolmogorov and allows the description of small-scale intermittency. It puts the problem of intermittency and dissipation in turbulence into a modern framework, compatible with recent mathematical advances on the proof of Onsager’s conjecture.},

	abstract = {A hybrid scheme that utilizes MPI for distributed memory parallelism and OpenMP for shared memory parallelism is presented. The work is motivated by the desire to achieve exceptionally high Reynolds numbers in pseudospectral computations of fluid turbulence on emerging petascale, high core-count, massively parallel processing systems. The hybrid implementation derives from and augments a well-tested scalable MPI-parallelized pseudospectral code. The hybrid paradigm leads to a new picture for the domain decomposition of the pseudospectral grids, which is helpful in understanding, among other things, the 3D transpose of the global data that is necessary for the parallel fast Fourier transforms that are the central component of the numerical discretizations. Details of the hybrid implementation are provided, and performance tests illustrate the utility of the method. It is shown that the hybrid scheme achieves good scalability up to ∼20,000 compute cores with a maximum efficiency of 89\%, and a mean of 79\%. Data are presented that help guide the choice of the optimal number of MPI tasks and OpenMP threads in order to maximize code performance on two different platforms.},

Periodic boundary conditions in the three spatial coordinates are considered. Different sets of initial conditions are chosen to explore the applicability of RMHD and to study how close the solution remains to the full compressible MHD solution as both freely evolve in time. In a first set, the initial state is prepared to satisfy the conditions assumed in the derivation of RMHD, namely, a strong mean magnetic field and plane-polarized fluctuations, varying weakly along the mean magnetic field. In those circumstances, simulations show that RMHD and CMHD3D evolve almost indistinguishably from one another. When some of the conditions are relaxed the agreement worsens but RMHD remains fairly close to CMHD3D, especially when the mean magnetic field is large enough. Moreover, the well-known spectral anisotropy effect promotes the dynamical attainment of the conditions for RMHD applicability. Global quantities (mean energies, mean-square current, and vorticity) and energy spectra from the two solutions are compared and point-to-point separation estimations are computed. The specific results shown here give support to the use of RMHD as a valid approximation of compressible MHD with a mean magnetic field under certain but quite practical conditions.},

Isotropy obtains in the large scales, with a spectral law compatible with the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory stemming from the weakening of nonlinear interactions due to Alfvén waves; scaling of structure functions confirms the non-Kolmogorovian nature of the flow in this range.

The resulting steady-state magnetic power spectrum in the dispersive range display exponents that vary within a range of values compatible with statistical results reported from in situ spacecraft measurements of solar wind turbulence as well as from gyrokinetic simulations. The spectral slopes are shown to depend on the strength of the nonlinear effects and on the scale at which turbulent fluctuations are driven in the simulations. The influence of Landau damping is addressed by comparison with simulations where the double-adiabatic closure is imposed. The role of FLR corrections is also analyzed. Comparison with in situ observations in the solar wind are performed to enlighten the influence of the fluctuations power at different scales on the spectral slopes in the sub-ion range. Using diagnosis of both magnetic compressibility and frequency-wavenumber spectra, it is shown that in spite of the evidence of the presence of fast-magnetosonic modes, the magnetic energy is mostly distributed around the kinetic Alfvén waves and the slow modes, in agreement with solar wind measurements. The observed large broadening about the linear dispersion relations may reflect the presence of coherent structures.},

In contrast, nonlinear mirror fluctuations are large compared to the ion Larmor scale and grow secularly in time; marginality is maintained by an increasing population of resonant particles trapped in magnetic mirrors. After one shear time, saturated order-unity magnetic mirrors are formed and particles scatter off their sharp edges.

Both analyses conﬁrm the dominance of the mirror mode for frequencies up to 1.4 Hz. Furthermore, by comparing the experimental charateristics of the identiﬁed mirror mode to the prediction of the linear theory, it is shown that the predicted maximum growth rate is observed in the frequency range 0–0.15 Hz, i.e. the FGM range. All the rest of the mirror mode, identiﬁed for higher frequencies is more likely to be a non linear extension of the most instable one.

When sufficiently small scales are retained, no artificial damping nor collisional effects is required. Simulations with large-scale Alfvenic driving show the development of perpendicular power-law spectra (taken at zero parallel wavenumber) with an exponent close to –2.8 for the perpendicular magnetic field at scales smaller than the ion inertial length. The electric field spectrum displays a break at intermediate scales, consistent with Solar Wind observations. These spectra appear in a quasi-stationary state after early-formed sheet-like density and current structures have evolved into filaments. In the presence of temperature anisotropy, the nonlinear development of the mirror instability leads to pressure-balanced magnetic structures surrounded by significant ion velocity fields perpendicular to the ambient field. At later time, the system becomes turbulent, with the disruption of the magnetic structures into parallel filaments.},

These are associated with the two Elsa¨sser energies. The existence of similarity solutions for the decay of turbulence with varying cross-helicity implies that these length scales cannot remain in proportion, opening the possibility for a wide variety of decay behaviour, in contrast to the simpler classic hydrodynamics case. Although the evolution equations for the second-order correlations lack explicit dependence on either the mean magnetic ﬁeld or the magnetic helicity, there is inherent implicit dependence on these (and other) quantities through the third-order correlations. The self-similar inertial range, a subclass of the general similarity case, inherits this complexity so that a single universal energy spectral law cannot be anticipated, even though the same pair of third-order laws holds for arbitrary crosshelicity and magnetic helicity. The straightforward notion of universality associated with Kolmogorov theory in hydrodynamics therefore requires careful generalization and reformulation in MHD.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

	abstract = {In the presence of an externally supported, mean magnetic field, a turbulent, conducting medium, such as plasma, becomes anisotropic. This mean magnetic field, which is separate from the fluctuating, turbulent part of the magnetic field, has considerable effects on the dynamics of the system. In this paper, we examine the dissipation rates for decaying incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with an increasing Reynolds number and in the presence of a mean magnetic field of varying strength. Proceeding numerically, we find that, as the Reynolds number increases, the dissipation rate asymptotes to a finite value for each magnetic-field strength, confirming the Kármán-Howarth hypothesis as applied to MHD. The asymptotic value of the dimensionless dissipation rate is initially suppressed from the zero-mean-field value by the mean magnetic field but then approaches a constant value for higher values of the mean-field strength. Additionally, for comparison, we perform a set of two-dimensional (2DMHD) and a set of reduced MHD (RMHD) simulations. We find that the RMHD results lie very close to the values corresponding to the high-mean-field limit of the three-dimensional runs while the 2DMHD results admit distinct values far from both the zero-mean-field cases and the high-mean-field limit of the three-dimensional cases. These findings provide firm underpinnings for numerous applications in space and astrophysics wherein von Kármán decay of turbulence is assumed.},

Based on the inviscid invariance of total energy, an exact relation is derived for homogeneous (not necessarily isotropic) turbulence. A modified definition for the two-point energy correlation functions is used to comply with the requirement of detailed energy equipartition in the acoustic limit. In contrast to the previous relations (S. Galtier and S. Banerjee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 134501 (2011); S. Banerjee and S. Galtier, Phys. Rev. E 87, 013019 (2013)), the current exact relation shows that the pressure dilatation terms play practically no role in the energy cascade. Both the flux and source terms are written in terms of two-point differences. Sources enter the relation in a form of mixed second-order structure functions. Unlike the kinetic and thermodynamic potential energies, the gravitational contribution is absent from the flux term. An estimate shows that, for the isotropic case, the correlation between density and gravitational acceleration may play an important role in modifying the energy transfer in self-gravitating turbulence. The exact relation is also written in an alternative form in terms of two-point correlation functions, which is then used to describe scale-by-scale energy budget in spectral space.},

Theor. 50, 015501 (2017)], an exact relation has been derived for the total energy transfer. This approach results in a simpler relation expressed entirely in terms of mixed second-order structure functions. The kinetic, thermodynamic, magnetic, and gravitational contributions to the energy transfer rate can be easily separated in the present form. By construction, the new formalism includes such additional effects as global rotation, the Hall term in the induction equation, etc. The analysis shows that solid-body rotation cannot alter the energy flux rate of compressible turbulence. However, the contribution of a uniform background magnetic field to the flux is shown to be nontrivial unlike in the incompressible case. Finally, the compressible, turbulent energy flux rate does not vanish completely due to simple alignments, which leads to a zero turbulent energy flux rate in the incompressible case.},

The time resolution of the magnetic field data allows us to study the power spectra up to 2 Hz. Generally, the corresponding spectral break frequency fb and the Doppler-shifted frequencies, which are related to the proton gyroradius and inertial scales, are close to a frequency f of about 0.5 Hz at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun. However, studying the radial evolution of the power spectra offers us the possibility to distinguish between those scales. Recent Ulysses observations show that, while the proton scales vary, fb stays nearly constant with the heliocentric distance R. In our study we confirm that fb varies within a small interval of [0.2, 0.4] Hz only, as R varies from 0.3 to 0.9 AU. Moreover, if we assume parallel propagating fluctuations (with respect to the solar wind flow or background magnetic field), we can show that none of the proton scales are coincident with the break scale. If, however, we take into account the two-dimensional nature of the turbulent fluctuations, then we can show that the spatial scale corresponding to fb(R) does follow the proton inertial scale, λp(R), but not the proton gyroradius scale, ρp(R), as a function of heliocentric distance. These observations indicate that the spectral break at the proton inertial scale might be related to the Hall effect, or be controlled by the ion-cyclotron damping of obliquely propagating fluctuations or the formation of current sheets scaling like λp, which could be responsible for ion heating through magnetic reconnection.},

	abstract = {How turbulent energy is dissipated in weakly collisional space and astrophysical plasmas is a major open question. Here, we present the application of a field-particle correlation technique to directly measure the transfer of energy between the turbulent electromagnetic field and electrons in the Earth’s magnetosheath, the region of solar wind downstream of the Earth’s bow shock. The measurement of the secular energy transfer from the parallel electric field as a function of electron velocity shows a signature consistent with Landau damping. This signature is coherent over time, close to the predicted resonant velocity, similar to that seen in kinetic Alfven turbulence simulations, and disappears under phase randomisation. This suggests that electron Landau damping could play a significant role in turbulent plasma heating, and that the technique is a valuable tool for determining the particle energisation processes operating in space and astrophysical plasmas},

These frequencies correspond to spatial scales in the plasma frame near the proton gyroradius ρi and proton inertial length di. At 1 AU it is difficult to determine which of these is associated with the break, since and the perpendicular ion plasma beta is typically β⊥i∼1. To address this, several exceptional intervals with β⊥i≪1 and β⊥i≫1 were investigated, during which these scales were well separated. It was found that for β⊥i≪1 the break occurs at di and for β⊥i≫1 at ρi, i.e., the larger of the two scales. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including Alfvén wave dispersion, damping, and current sheets.},

Comparing scaling relations, we find that both EMHD and ERMHD turbulence show similar spectra and anisotropy. We develop new techniques to study anisotropy of EMHD turbulence. Our detailed study of anisotropy of EMHD turbulence supports our earlier result of k‖ ∝ k1/3⊥ scaling, where k‖ and k⊥ are wavenumbers parallel and perpendicular to local direction of magnetic field, respectively. We find that the high-order statistics show a scaling that is similar to the She–Leveque scaling for incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence and different from that of incompressible MHD turbulence. We observe that the bispectra, which characterize the interaction of different scales within the turbulence cascade, are very different for EMHD and MHD turbulence. We show that both decaying and driven EMHD turbulence have the same statistical properties. We calculate the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of MHD and EMHD turbulence and compare them with those of interplanetary turbulence. We find that, as in the case of the solar wind, the PDFs of the increments of magnetic field strength in MHD and EMHD turbulence are well described by the Tsallis distribution.

	abstract = {Estimates of the power spectra of the solar-wind magnetic field B and the radial component of the solarwind plasma velocity V have been computed for the frequency range from one cycle per solar rotation to 1.35 X 10\_1 Hz. The measurements used in the calculations were obtained in 1962 with instruments on board the spacecraft Mariner 2. From the spectral properties of the plasma fluctuations, it is tentatively concluded that the solar-wind flow is often turbulent in the region near 1.0 a.u. A heuristic model of the turbulent flow that is consistent with the observations is one in which the energy for the turbulence is derived from the differential motion of the streams in the solar-wind plasma. Instabilities associated with the differential streaming produce long-wavelength Alfvén waves. The energy extracted from the differential motion cascades through a hierarchy of Alfvén waves until it reaches waves short enough for dissipation by proton cyclotron damping. As a result of this turbulent process the differential motion of the plasma streams is eliminated. During the Mariner 2 flight the mean variation in the streaming velocity over one period of solar rotation was 86 km sec“1, so that the energy available in the plasma at 1 0 a.u. due to this differential motion was about 3.8 X 1013 ergs gm“1. The inertial-range spectrum of the turbulence evidently extended from about 10 cycles per day to somewhere above the magnetometer Nyquist frequency, 1.35 X 10“2 Hz. At these frequencies, the fluctuations in B were primarily transverse to the spiral-field direction. The fluctuations in the radial components of V and B exhibited equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy, and the frequency dependences of both variables were roughly J“12. The difference between the observed/“12 dependence and the/"16 dependence for such turbulence predicted by Kraichnan is tentatively attributed to fluctuations at the higher frequencies, described by Scarf, Wolfe, and Silva, that result from the operation of the garden-hose instability. Evidence for dissipation in the range/ {\textgreater} 0.2 Hz, probably due to proton cyclotron damping, is cited. The power density in the inertial range indicates that the approximate mean rate of dissipation due to turbulence near 1.0 a u. was 2.4 X 106 ergs gm"1 sec"1. The lower limit for turbulent heating of the solar-wind protons between the Sun and 1.0 a.u. is estimated to have been 3.6 X 103 ° K. The integral of the spectrum of the plasma fluctuations over the entire frequency range shows that energy remaining in the differential streaming and turbulence at 1.0 a.u. was sufficient to heat the protons by another 8 X 10s ° K.},

We prove the result under a “∗-Hölder condition” which is somewhat stronger than usual Hölder continuity. Our argument establishes also the fundamental result that the instantaneous (sub-scale) energy transfer is dominated by local triadic interactions for a ∗-Hölder solution with exponenth in the range 0 {\textless} h {\textless} 1. However, we must use a “band-averaged” energy flux for the proof: as we explain, the ordinary definition of the flux fails to adequately measure transport in wavenumber space (scale), since it is insensitive to the distance through which energy is displaced by individual interactions. We discuss some connections of the results with phenomenological theories of fully-developed turbulence, the 1941 Kolmogorov theory and the “multifractal model” of Parisi and Frisch.},

However, compressive forcing yields stronger compression at the same rms Mach number than solenoidal forcing, resulting in a three times larger standard deviation of volumetric and column density probability distributions (PDFs). We compare our results to different characterisations of several observed regions, and find evidence of different forcing functions. Column density PDFs in the Perseus MC suggest the presence of a mainly compressive forcing agent within a shell, driven by a massive star. Although the PDFs are close to log-normal, they have non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis caused by intermittency. Centroid velocity increments measured in the Polaris Flare on intermediate scales agree with solenoidal forcing on that scale. However, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Δ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-variance analysis of the column density in the Polaris Flare suggests that turbulence is driven on large scales, with a significant compressive component on the forcing scale. This indicates that, although likely driven with mostly compressive modes on large scales, turbulence can behave like solenoidal turbulence on smaller scales. Principal component analysis of G216-2.5 and most of the Rosette MC agree with solenoidal forcing, but the interior of an ionised shell within the Rosette MC displays clear signatures of compressive forcing.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The strong dependence of the density PDF on the type of forcing must be taken into account in any theory using the PDF to predict properties of star formation. We supply a quantitative description of this dependence.

Finally, we emphasise the role of the sonic scale for protostellar core formation, because core formation close to the sonic scale would naturally explain the observed subsonic velocity dispersions of protostellar cores.},

We consider the extent to which this steepening can be described, using a magnetohydrodynamic formulation that includes the Hall term. An important characteristic of Hall MHD is that although the ion cyclotron resonance is included, there is no wave-particle dissipation of energy. In this study we use a compressible Hall MHD code with a constant magnetic field and a polytropic equation of state. Artificial dissipation in the form of a bi-Laplacian operator is used to suppress numerical instabilities, allowing for a clear separation of the dissipative scales from the ion cyclotron scales. A distinct steepening appears in the simulation power spectra near the cyclotron resonance for certain types of initial conditions. This steepening is associated with the appearance of right circularly polarized fluctuations at frequencies above the ion cyclotron resonance. Similar steepenings and polarization enhancements are observed in solar wind magnetic field data.},

	abstract = {We investigated the inertial and dissipation ranges of the reduced magnetic helicity spectrum of solar wind fluctuations and have found that this spectrum appears insensitive to solar cycle variations and changes in solar wind flow parameters. In the inertial range of the spectrum, the reduced helicity is large but random and independent of heliocentric distance between 0.3 and 10 AU. At small scales, in the dissipation range of the spectrum, a correlation appears to exist between the average value of the normalized reduced magnetic helicity and the polarity of magnetic sectors, suggesting that these fluctuations, if outward propagating, are predominantly right-hand polarized. In the inertial range the statistical properties of the normalized magnetic helicity are well approximated by a simple model of the magnetic field in which the total magnetic field vector randomly walks with only small variations in magnitude. The behavior of the inertial range spectrum is very similar to that seen in three- and two-and-a-half-dimensional simulations of the incompressible and compressible equations describing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, consistent with the paradigm that the solar wind is a turbulent magnetofluid.},

	abstract = {The wave–particle interaction processes occurring in the solar wind provide crucial information to understand the wave dissipation and simultaneous particle heating in plasma turbulence. One requires observations of both wave fluctuations and particle kinetics near the dissipation range, which have, however, not yet been analyzed simultaneously. Here we show new evidence of wave–particle interactions by combining the diagnosis of wave modes with the analysis of particle kinetics on the basis of measurements from the WIND spacecraft with a high cadence of about 3 s. Solar wind protons appear to be highly dynamic in their velocity distribution consisting of varying anisotropic core and beam components. The basic scenario of solar wind proton heating through wave–particle interaction is suggested to be the following. Left-handed cyclotron resonance occurs continuously, and is evident from the observed proton core velocity distribution and the concurrent quasi-parallel left-handed Alfvén cyclotron waves. Landau and right-handed cyclotron resonances are persistent and indicated by the observed drifting anisotropic beam and the simultaneous quasi-perpendicular right-handed kinetic Alfvén waves in a general sense. The persistence of non-gyrotropic proton distributions may cast new light on the nature of the interaction between particles and waves near and beyond the proton gyro-frequency.},

	abstract = {The relationship between a decaying strong turbulence and kinetic instabilities in a slowly expanding plasma is investigated using two-dimensional (2D) hybrid expanding box simulations. We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of large-scale, linearly polarized, random-phase Alfvénic fluctuations that have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops; magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at ion scales. The turbulent cascade leads to an overall anisotropic proton heating, protons are heated in the perpendicular direction, and, initially, also in the parallel direction. The imposed expansion leads to generation of a large parallel proton temperature anisotropy which is at later stages partly reduced by turbulence. The turbulent heating is not sufficient to overcome the expansion-driven perpendicular cooling and the system eventually drives the oblique firehose instability in a form of localized nonlinear wave packets which efficiently reduce the parallel temperature anisotropy. This work demonstrates that kinetic instabilities may coexist with strong plasma turbulence even in a constrained 2D regime.},

And, if not, how is thermal energy partitioned between ions and electrons? This is a fundamental question in plasma physics, the answer to which is also crucial for predicting the properties of far-distant astronomical objects such as accretion disks around black holes. In the context of disks, this question was posed nearly two decades ago and has since generated a sizeable literature. Here we provide the answer for the case in which energy is injected into the plasma via Alfvénic turbulence: Collisionless turbulent heating typically acts to disequilibrate the ion and electron temperatures. Numerical simulations using a hybrid fluid-gyrokinetic model indicate that the ion–electron heating-rate ratio is an increasing function of the thermal-to-magnetic energy ratio, βiβi{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}β{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}i{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}: It ranges from ∼0.05∼0.05{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}0.05{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} at βi=0.1βi=0.1{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}β{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}i{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}={\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}0.1{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} to at least 30 for βi≳10βi≳10{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}β{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}i{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}≳{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}10{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a flurry of research activity focused on discerning the physics of kinetic scale turbulence in high-speed astrophysical plasma flows. By ‘kinetic’ we mean spatial scales on the order of or, in particular, smaller than the ion inertial length or the ion gyro-radius—the spatial scales at which the ion and electron bulk velocities decouple and considerable change can be seen in the ion distribution functions. The motivation behind most of these studies is to find the ultimate fate of the energy cascade of plasma turbulence, and thereby the channels by which the energy in the system is dissipated. This brief Introduction motivates the case for a themed issue on this topic and introduces the topic of turbulent dissipation and heating in the solar wind. The theme issue covers the full breadth of studies: from theory and models, massive simulations of these models and observational studies from the highly rich and vast amount of data collected from scores of heliospheric space missions since the dawn of the space age. A synopsis of the theme issue is provided, where a brief description of all the contributions is discussed and how they fit together to provide an over-arching picture on the highly topical subject of dissipation and heating in turbulent collisionless plasmas in general and in the solar wind in particular.},

Our numerical experiments describe nonmagnetized driven turbulent ﬂows with an isothermal equation of state and an rms Mach number of 6. We discuss numerical resolution issues and demonstrate convergence, in a statistical sense, of the inertial range dynamics in simulations on grids larger than 5123 points. The simulations allowed us to measure the absolute velocity scaling exponents for the ﬁrst time. The inertial range velocity scaling in this strongly compressible regime deviates substantially from the incompressible Kolmogorov laws. The slope of the velocity power spectrum, for instance, is À1.95 compared to À5/3 in the incompressible case. The exponent of the third-order velocity structure function is 1.28, while in incompressible turbulence it is known to be unity. We propose a natural extension of Kolmogorov’s phenomenology that takes into account compressibility by mixing the velocity and density statistics and preserves the Kolmogorov scaling of the power spectrum and structure functions of the density-weighted velocity v    1=3u. The low-order statistics of v appear to be invariant with respect to changes in the Mach number. For instance, at Mach 6 the slope of the power spectrum of v is À1.69, and the exponent of the third-order structure function of v is unity. We also directly measure the mass dimension of the ‘‘fractal’’ density distribution in the inertial subrange, Dm \% 2:4, which is similar to the observed fractal dimension of molecular clouds and agrees well with the cascade phenomenology.},

	abstract = {The dissipation range for interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations is formed by those fluctuations with spatial scales comparable to the gyroradius or ion inertial length of a thermal ion. It is reasonable to assume that the dissipation range represents the final fate of magnetic energy that is transferred from the largest spatial scales via nonlinear processes until kinetic coupling with the background plasma removes the energy from the spectrum and heats the background distribution. Typically, the dissipation range at 1 AU sets in at spacecraft frame frequencies of a few tenths of a hertz. It is characterized by a steepening of the power spectrum and often demonstrates a bias of the polarization or magnetic helicity spectrum. We examine Wind observations of inertial and dissipation range spectra in an attempt to better understand the processes that form the dissipation range and how these processes depend on the ambient solar wind parameters (interplanetary magnetic field intensity, ambient proton density and temperature, etc.). We focus on stationary intervals with well-defined inertial and dissipation range spectra. Our analysis shows that parallel-propagating waves, such as Alfvén waves, are inconsistent with the data. MHD turbulence consisting of a partly slab and partly two-dimensional (2-D) composite geometry is consistent with the observations, while thermal paxticle interactions with the 2-D component may be responsible for the formation of the dissipation range. Kinetic Alfvén waves propagating at large angles to the background magnetic field are also consistent with the observations and may form some portion of the 2-D turbulence component.},

The compressive turbulence level is found to be closely related to the stream structure or latitudinal location with respect to the heliospheric current sheet. Compressive turbulence in low-speed flows is more fully developed and intense. The spectra are radially invariant and come close to a −5/3 spectral law. In contrast, fast stream turbulence becomes increasingly compressive, in terms of radially growing amplitudes of δn/n and δB/B, with increasing heliocentric distance. The spectra reveal a flatter high-frequency part, which gradually seems to get straightened out at large solar distances. Single case studies, as well as averaged spectra and their spectral features, are presented and discussed in the context of the theoretical turbulence literature.},

Below these scales a power law index around \$-2.5\$ is often measured and associated to nonlinear dispersive processes. Recent observations reveal a third region at scales below the electron inertial length. This region is characterized by a steeper spectrum that some refer to it as the dissipation range. We investigate this range of scales in the electron magnetohydrodynamic approximation and derive an exact and universal law for a third-order structure function. This law can predict a magnetic fluctuation spectrum with an index of \$-11/3\$ which is in agreement with the observed spectrum at the smallest scales. We conclude on the possible existence of a third turbulence regime in the solar wind instead of a dissipation range as recently postulated.},

	abstract = {Laws governing the behavior of statistical third-order moments in the inertial range are among the few rigorous results in the theory of statistically homogeneous incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. These fundamental laws apply to both isotropic and anisotropic turbulence. Assuming that the turbulence is stationary in time and statistically axisymmetric under proper rotations about the direction of the mean magnetic field, it is shown that the general mathematical form of the tensor quantities appearing in these laws is constrained by symmetry to have a particular form. Using these forms, the general solutions of the law for the vector and pseudovector third-order moments F and FC are obtained in the limit of large kinetic Reynolds number and large magnetic Reynolds number. The physical meaning of the different terms in F and FC are investigated and a method for obtaining the cascade rates of energy ϵ and cross-helicity ϵC from experimental data is described. The results show that the measurement of the cascade rates goes hand-in-hand with the measurement of the spatial anisotropy of the third-order moments F and FC. The theory developed here can be applied to measure the turbulent cascade rates of energy and cross-helicity in laboratory plasma experiments, numerical simulations, and the solar wind.},

Considerable evidence exists that the turbulence is not fully dissipated near the proton scale, but continues cascading down to electron scales. However, the scaling of the magnetic energy spectra as well as the nature of the plasma modes involved at those small scales are still not fully determined. Here we survey 10 yr of the Cluster STAFF search-coil magnetometer waveforms measured in the SW and perform a statistical study of the magnetic energy spectra in the frequency range [1, 180] Hz. We found that 75\% of the analyzed spectra exhibit breakpoints near the electron gyroscale ρe, followed by steeper power-law-like spectra. We show that the scaling below the electron breakpoint cannot be determined unambiguously due to instrumental limitations that we discuss in detail. We compare our results to those reported in other studies and discuss their implications for the physical mechanisms involved and for theoretical modeling of energy dissipation in the SW.},

We find that a minimum of a year of data is normally required to get good convergence and statistically significant results. We then apply these findings to 10 years of observations spanning both solar minimum and solar maximum conditions. We compare the computed energy cascade rates with previously determined rates of proton heating at 1 AU as determined from the radial gradient of the proton temperature to be proportional to the product of wind speed and proton temperature. We find good agreement with a moderate excess of energy within the cascade that is consistent with previous estimates for thermal electron heating in the solar wind. In keeping with earlier analyses of the dissipation spectrum, we postulate that electron heating by the turbulent cascade is less than and at most equal to the rate of proton heating.},

	abstract = {Solar wind magnetic fluctuation power spectra at frequencies ƒ {\textless} 1 Hz are commonly observed to have the approximate power law dependence ƒ−5/3. These observations may be described by Kolmogorov diffusion in wavenumber space which defines what is called the inertial range. At wavelengths shorter than the inertial range, spectra often are observed to have steeper power laws. This intermediate wavelength regime is sometimes called the dissipation range because it has been suggested that this steeper slope is caused by collisionless damping of Alfvén and magnetosonic waves. Here it is argued that, at intermediate wavenumbers, Alfvén fluctuations are suppressed by proton cyclotron damping, so the observed power spectra are likely to consist of weakly damped magnetosonic/whistler waves which have an increased wavenumber diffusion rate due to their dispersion. Numerical calculations at βp ≲ 2.5 with a model representing this picture yield fluctuation spectra with steep power laws at intermediate wavenumbers and with sharp cutoffs due to electron cyclotron damping at still shorter wavelengths. The term “dispersion range” is more appropriate to describe steep power law spectra in the intermediate wavenumber regime.},

Assuming initially equal and isotropic ion and electron temperatures, and an ion beta equal to unity, different simulations are performed by varying the propagation direction and the amplitude of KAWs that are randomly driven at a transverse wavenumber k0 such that (where di is the proton inertial length), in order to maintain a prescribed level of turbulent fluctuations. The resulting turbulent regimes are characterized by the nonlinearity parameter, defined as the ratio of the characteristic times of Alfvén wave propagation and of the transverse nonlinear dynamics. The corresponding transverse magnetic energy spectra display power laws with exponents spanning a range of values consistent with spacecraft observations. The meandering of the magnetic field lines and the homogenization of ion temperature along these lines are shown to be related to the strength of the turbulence, measured by the nonlinearity parameter. The results are interpreted in terms of a recently proposed phenomenological model where the homogenization process along field lines induced by Landau damping plays a central role.},

We examine these rates as functions of proton temperature and solar wind speed, comparing them to the expected rate based on the heating of protons at 1 AU. The average Kolmogorov rate is consistently more than a factor of 10 greater than expected. We conclude that the cascade rate cannot be estimated using the Kolmogorov prescription and power spectra. The Kraichnan rate is close to the expected rate and is potentially a good way to estimate the cascade rate. No distinction is found between the isotropic and cross-field rates at 1 AU. However, consideration of the likely dependence of cascade rates with distance from the Sun shows that a distinction should exist at distances closer than 1 AU but not outside 1 AU. Moreover, we find that inside 1 AU, the cross-field Kraichnan prediction can maintain agreement with the expected heating rate whereas the isotropic prediction cannot.},

	abstract = {Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and often exhibit non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the growth of microinstabilities—that is, enhanced electric and magnetic fields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play an active role in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence induced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of Alfvénic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC simulation is of decaying turbulence that develops both coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular to the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory using the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the simulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially occur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may affect the plasma globally, they act locally and develop in response to extreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further studies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.},

	abstract = {Weakly collisional magnetized cosmic plasmas have a dynamical tendency to develop pressure anisotropies with respect to the local direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. These anisotropies trigger plasma instabilities at scales just above the ion Larmor radius ρi and much below the mean free path λmfp. They have growth rates of a fraction of the ion cyclotron frequency, which is much faster than either the global dynamics or even local turbulence. Despite their microscopic nature, these instabilities dramatically modify the transport properties and, therefore, the macroscopic dynamics of the plasma. The non-linear evolution of these instabilities is expected to drive pressure anisotropies towards marginal stability values, controlled by the plasma beta βi. Here this non-linear evolution is worked out in an ab initio kinetic calculation for the simplest analytically tractable example – the parallel (k⊥ = 0) ﬁrehose instability in a highbeta plasma. An asymptotic theory is constructed, based on a particular physical ordering and leading to a closed non-linear equation for the ﬁrehose turbulence. In the non-linear regime, both the analytical theory and the numerical solution predict secular (∝t) growth of magnetic ﬂuctuations. The ﬂuctuations develop a k−3 spectrum, extending from scales somewhat larger than ρi to the maximum scale that grows secularly with time (∝t1/2); the relative pressure anisotropy (p⊥ − p )/p tends to the marginal value −2/βi. The marginal state is achieved via changes in the magnetic ﬁeld, not particle scattering. When a parallel ion heat ﬂux is present, the parallel ﬁrehose mutates into the new gyrothermal instability (GTI), which continues to exist up to ﬁrehose-stable values of pressure anisotropy, which can be positive and are limited by the magnitude of the ion heat ﬂux. The non-linear evolution of the GTI also features secular growth of magnetic ﬂuctuations, but the ﬂuctuation spectrum is eventually dominated by modes around a maximal scale ∼ρilT/λmfp, where lT is the scale of the parallel temperature variation. Implications for momentum and heat transport are speculated about. This study is motivated by our interest in the dynamics of galaxy cluster plasmas (which are used as the main astrophysical example), but its relevance to solar wind and accretion ﬂow plasmas is also brieﬂy discussed.},

In particular, the calculation of the current density and the study of the changes in the ring current is an active field of research as it is a good proxy for the magnetic activity. The curlometer technique allows the current density to be calculated from the magnetic field measured at four different positions inside a given current sheet using the Maxwell-Ampere's law. In 2009, the CLUSTER perigee pass was located at about 2 {\textless}I{\textgreater}R{\textless}/I{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{E}}$ allowing a study of the ring current deep inside the inner magnetosphere, where the pressure gradient is expected to invert direction. In this paper, we use the curlometer in such an orbit. As the method has never been used so deep inside the inner magnetosphere, this study is a test of the curlometer in a part of the magnetosphere where the magnetic field is very high (about 4000 nT) and changes over small distances (\&Delta;{\textless}I{\textgreater}B{\textless}/I{\textgreater} = 1nT in 1000 km). To do so, the curlometer has been applied to calculate the current density from measured and modelled magnetic fields and for different sizes of the tetrahedron. The results show that the current density cannot be calculated using the curlometer technique at low altitude perigee passes, but that the method may be accurate in a [3 {\textless}I{\textgreater}R{\textless}/I{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{E}}$; 5 {\textless}I{\textgreater}R{\textless}/I{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{E}}$] or a [6 {\textless}I{\textgreater}R{\textless}/I{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{E}}$; 8.3 {\textless}I{\textgreater}R{\textless}/I{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{E}}$] L-shell range. It also demonstrates that the parameters used to estimate the accuracy of the method are necessary, but not sufficient conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We focus here on the first application of the Curlometer (direct estimation of the electric current density from curl(B), using measured spatial gradients of the magnetic field) analysis technique. The applicability of this multipoint technique is tested, for selected events within the data set, in the context of various mission constraints (such as position, timing, and experimental accuracy). For the Curlometer, nonconstant spatial gradients over the spacecraft volume, time dependence, and measurement errors can degrade the quality of the estimate. The estimated divergence of the magnetic field can be used to monitor (indirectly) the effect of nonconstant gradients in the case of many magnetic field structures. For others, and at highly distorted spacecraft configurations, this test may not reflect the quality of the Curlometer well. The relative scales and relative geometry between the spacecraft array and the structures present, as well as measurement errors, all are critical to the quality of the calculation. We demonstrate that even when instrumental and other errors are known to contribute to the uncertainty in the estimate of the current, a number of current signatures within the magnetosphere can be plausibly determined in direction, if not absolute size. A number of examples show consistent currents at the magnetopause, both separate from, and nearby or in the cusp region. Field-aligned currents near the polar cap boundary are also estimated reliably. We also demonstrate one example of an anomalous current arising from the effect of a highly distorted spacecraft configuration.},

Knowledge of spacecraft separations, magnetic field measurement accuracy, and the form of the current structures sampled (e.g., relative scale size) limits the accuracy of the method. Despite these conditions of application, in many regions of the magnetosphere it has been shown to be robust and reliable. A number of studies have applied the method successfully such as: the ring current; the magnetotail current sheet; the magnetopause currents, and field aligned currents, as well as to other current structures (e.g., flux tubes). Where time stationarity and other special assumptions can be made, or where the spacecraft configuration is highly irregular or less than four spacecraft are available, the method can still be applied to obtain partial components of the current. We discuss the application of the curlometer technique to the four-point observations from the Cluster mission in terms of its adaptability and performance (including the lessons learned) and illustrate its use with recent data from the MMS mission, which covers a much smaller spatial regime.},

The methodology is modified from a previous, fully 3-D gradient analysis technique, designed to apply strictly to 4-point measurements and to be stable for regular spacecraft configurations. Here, we adapt the method to be tolerant against distorted configurations and to return a partial result when fewer spacecraft measurements are available. We apply the method to a variety of important physical quantities, such as the electric current density and the vorticity of plasma flows based on Cluster and THEMIS multiple-point measurements. The method may also have valuable applications on the coming Swarm mission.},

	abstract = {The role of supersonic turbulence in structuring the interstellar medium (ISM) remains an unsettled question. Here, this problem is investigated using a new exact law of compressible isothermal hydrodynamic turbulence, which involves two-point correlations in physical space. The new law is shown to have a compact expression that contains a single ﬂux term reminiscent of the incompressible case and a source term with a simple expression whose sign is given by the divergence of the velocity. The law is then used to investigate the properties of such a turbulence at integral Mach number 4 produced by a massive numerical simulation with a grid resolution of 10, 0483 points. The ﬂux (resp. source) term was found to have positive (resp. negative) contribution to the total energy cascade rate, which is interpreted as a direct cascade ampliﬁed by compression, while their sum is constant in the inertial range. Using a local (in space) analysis it is shown that the source is mainly driven by ﬁlamentary structures in which the ﬂux is negligible. Taking positive deﬁned correlations reveals the existence of different turbulent regimes separated by the sonic scale, which determines the scale over which the nonnegligible source modiﬁes the scaling of the ﬂux. Our study provides new insight into the dynamics and structures of supersonic interstellar turbulence.},

Based on multipoint measurements, the k-filtering technique allows, for the first time, to estimate the Magnetic Field Energy Distribution (MFED) in both the angular frequency and wave vector space. We show how the localisation of the magnetic energy in the (ω, k) domain can be used to identify the linear modes that can propagate in the magnetosheath. A comparison between k-filtering results and prediction of the linear theory is performed. For the frequencies examined the magnetic energy seems to be distributed over the low frequency modes: mirror, Alfven, and slow modes. Estimation of Doppler shift shows that each frequency observed is the superposition of different frequencies in the plasma frame. This ``mixture of modes'' at a given observed frequency explains why the fluctuations are generally not observed to be polarized, as shown in previous studies. Some other implications on a weak turbulence approach of the magnetic fluctuations in the magnetosheath are discussed.},

Here, we provide a complementary assessment of their role in the turbulent cascade. The validation of the third-order linear scaling of velocity and magnetic fluctuations in intervals characterized by a high occurrence of switchbacks suggests that, irrespective of their local or remote origin, these structures are actively embedded in the turbulent cascade, at least at the radial distances sampled by PSP during its first perihelion. The stronger positive energy transfer rate observed in periods with a predominance of switchbacks indicates that they act as a mechanism injecting additional energy in the turbulence cascade.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the concept of wave-particle thermodynamic equilibrium in order to improve our understanding of the role of turbulent heating in the solar wind proton plasma. The thermodynamic equilibrium in plasmas requires the energy of a plasmon—the quantum of plasma fundamental oscillation—to be balanced by the proton-magnetized plasma energy, that is, the magnetic field and proton kinetic/thermal energy. This equilibrium has already been confirmed in several prior analyses, but also in this paper, by analyzing (i) multi-spacecraft data sets along the radial profile of the inner heliosphere, and (ii) representative data sets of a variety of 27 different space and astrophysical plasmas. Recently, it was shown that the slow mode of the near-Earth solar wind plasma is characterized by a missing energy source that is necessary for keeping the energy balance in the plasmon–proton-magnetized plasma. Here we show strong evidence that this missing energy is the turbulent energy heating the solar wind. In particular, we derive and compare the radial and velocity profiles of this missing energy and the turbulent energy in the inner heliosphere, also considering other minor contributions, such as the temperature of pickup protons. The connection of the missing plasmon–proton energy with the turbulent energy provides a new method for estimating and cross-examining the turbulent energy in space and astrophysical plasmas, while it confirms the universality of the involved new Planck-type constant that implies a large-scale quantization.},

	abstract = {The possibility of using fluid equations in collisionless plasmas is revisited, and the conditions of validity of several possible closure equations are investigated. A new derivation of the well-known “double-adiabatic” Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) laws is first presented. These laws are shown to demand two different kinds of conditions for ensuring (1) particle gyrotropy and (2) adiabaticity. Both kinds of conditions are investigated in detail. The usual slow and large-scales conditions (hereafter “sls”), which are shown to be necessary for gyrotropy, are provided in a rigorous form. The role of the fundamental symmetries of the system, especially in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, is also emphasized for determining any “fluid-type” behavior of a collisionless magnetoplasma. More general closure equations are afterwards proposed, relaxing first the conditions for adiabaticity and then, more speculatively, the sls conditions for gyrotropy. The dependence of these new closure equations on the shape of the velocity distribution functions is discussed, the CGL case being singular since it is shown to be fully independent of this shape.},

The single expansion parameter is the ratio between the largest among the gyroradii and any other characteristic length, which is assumed to be small but finite in a magnetized medium. This formalism allows a complete account of the gyroviscous stress, the pressure anisotropy, and the anisotropic heat fluxes, and is valid for arbitrary magnetic geometry, arbitrary plasma pressure, and fully electromagnetic nonlinear dynamics.

In this paper, we examine the parallel firehose instability in electron-positron plasmas based on the particle simulations along with the linear fluid theory, which may give rise to the dispersion relation, instability criteria, and growth rate, etc., for comparisons with those calculated from the kinetic simulations. As for the firehose instability in electron-proton plasmas, the magnetic field grows rapidly and then decreases with oscillations. The nonlinear saturated state complies with the linear stability criterion, α=μ0(P{\textbar}{\textbar}−P⊥)/B2=1, derived from the fluid theory only for relatively smaller values of initial α or ωp/ωc, where ωp and ωc are the plasma and cyclotron frequencies, respectively. For relatively larger values of initial α and ωp/ωc, the saturated α values are smaller than 1 as a result of kinetic resonant effects. The dominant wave numbers are kc/ωp{\textless}0.5 and the growth rates are in the range of 0.1–0.3ωc, which are approximately consistent with the linear fluid theory for the same wavelengths. Both electrostatic and electromagnetic modes predicted by the linear fluid theory are identified in the kinetic simulations.},

	abstract = {This is the second of two papers dealing with a systematic study of the linearized problems in magneto-hydrodynamics of incompressible and compressible fluids. The first paper (Banos 1955) deals mainly with the general theory of plane homogeneous waves and of time harmonic cylindrical waves propagating in a homogeneous and isotropic conducting fluid of infinite extent embedded in a uniform field of magnetic induction. The medium is assumed to consist of an ideal fluid devoid of viscosity and expansive friction, which is characterized (in rationalized mks units) by the rigorously constant macroscopic parameters μ , ε and σ , where μ ε = c-2 and σ is the (ohmic) conductivity. The present paper deals with the application of the general theory to the determination of the modes of propagation and to the computation of the corresponding propagation constants. It is shown that an incompressible fluid sustains two types of modes: one type devoid of pressure fluctuations (velocity modes), and the other accompanied by pressure oscillations (pressure modes). In the case of cylindrical waves in an incompressible fluid there are two distinct pressure modes, one of which, however, is highly attenuated and therefore of little physical interest. It is found that a compressible fluid also sustains the same class of velocity modes (devoid of pressure fluctuations and hence independent of the velocity of sound in the medium) as an incompressible fluid. In addition, a compressible fluid is shown to propagate two distinct pressure modes which, under appropriate limiting conditions peculiar to each type, behave respectively as a modified sound wave and as a modified magneto-hydrodynamic wave. And, for every mode discussed here, there are presented the limiting forms of the propagation constant in three cases of physical interest: infinite conductivity, slightly attenuated modes, and weak magneto-hydrodynamic coupling which arises when the externally applied field is vanishingly small.},

	abstract = {Classical fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics; that is, it proceeds on the assumption that a fluid is practically continuous and homogeneous in structure. The fundamental property which distinguishes a fluid from other continuous media is that it cannot be in equilibrium in a state of stress such that the mutual action between two adjacent parts is oblique to the common surface. Though this property is the basis of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, it is by itself insufficient for the description of fluid motion. In order to characterize the physical behavior of a fluid the property must be extended, given suitable analytical form, and introduced into the equations of motion of a general continuous medium, this leading ultimately to a system of differential equations which are to be satisfied by the, velocity, density, pressure, etc. of an arbitrary fluid motion. In this article we shall consider these differential equations, their derivation from fundamental axioms, and the various forms which they take when more or less special assumptions concerning the fluid or the fluid motion are made.},

The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field. The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth. Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions. Physicists, teachers, scholars, biologists, and anyone interested in the principle and modern applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics will find this classic monograph an invaluable reference.},

Even though the large scale features are quite different, the finding is that the decomposition of the energy transfer is structurally very similar in the two cases. In the reconnection case, the time evolution of the energy transfer also exhibits a correlation with the reconnection rate. These results provide explicit evidence that reconnection dynamics fundamentally involves turbulence-like energy transfer.},

It is shown that the classical CGL model very accurately describes the growth rate of these instabilities at sufficiently long spatial scales (small wavenumbers). The required stabilization of these instabilities at small spatial scales (high wavenumbers) naturally requires dispersive effects, and the stabilization is due to the Hall term and finite Larmor radius corrections to the pressure tensor. Even though the stabilization is not completely accurate, since at small spatial scales a relatively strong collisionless damping comes into effect, we find that the main concepts of the maximum growth rate and the stabilization of these instabilities is indeed present in the fluid description. However, there are differences that are quite pronounced when close to the firehose threshold, and that clarify the different profiles for marginally stable states with a prescribed maximum growth rate in the simple fluid models considered here and the kinetic description.},

A turbulent cascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at sub-ion scales. The imposed expansion (taking a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field) leads to the generation of an important perpendicular proton temperature anisotropy that eventually drives the mirror instability. This instability generates large-amplitude, nonpropagating, compressible, pressure-balanced magnetic structures in a form of magnetic enhancements/humps that reduce the perpendicular temperature anisotropy.},

We used to estimate the local energy transfer rate at scale σ from the THEMIS-B and Parker Solar Probe data taken in the solar wind at different heliospheric distances. Our study reveals that discontinuities near the Sun lead to a strong energy transfer that affects a wide range of scales σ. We also observe that switchbacks seem to be characterized by a singular behavior with an energy transfer varying as σ −3/4, which slightly differs from classical discontinuities characterized by a σ −1 scaling. A comparison between the measurements of ε and shows that in general the latter is significantly larger than the former.},

Thus, linear waves were detected, that is Alfvén waves and fast and slow magnetosonic waves. Furthermore, different responses of the plasma were found according to whether the Mach number or the mean-magnetic field was varied. On the other hand, making use of spatiotemporal spectra and two different integration methods, we accurately quantified the amount of energy present in each of the normal modes.

Observations are sorted by the rate of Coulomb interactions, or collisional age, in the plasma and the differential flow between the two species. We show that helium is preferentially heated perpendicular to the magnetic field direction by more than a factor of 6 when the flow between the species is small relative to the Alfvén wave speed and collisions are infrequent. These signatures are consistent with predictions of dissipation in the presence of multiple ion species. We also report an unexpected result: observations of efficient heating of helium parallel to the magnetic field for large differential flow relative to the sound speed.},

Solving this problem has been one of the major goals of the Cluster mission. For that purpose multipoint measurements techniques, such as the k-ﬁltering, have been developed. Such techniques combine several time series recorded simultaneously at different points in space to estimate the corresponding energy density in the wavenumber space. Here we apply the technique to both simulated and Cluster magnetometer data in the solar wind (SW) and investigate the errors and limitations that arise due to the separation of the spacecraft and the quality of the tetrahedral conﬁguration. Speciﬁcally, we provide an estimation of the minimum and maximum scales that can be accurately measured given a speciﬁc distance between the satellites and show the importance of the geometry of the tetrahedron and the relationship of that geometry to spatial aliasing. We also present recent results on characterizing small scale SW turbulence and provide scientiﬁc arguments supporting the need of new magnetometers having better sensitivity than the existing ones. Throughout the paper we emphasize technical challenges and their solutions that can be considered for a better preparation of the Cross-Scale mission.},

This means that MHD equations with Braginskii viscosity are not well posed and fully kinetic description is necessary. In this paper, we review the basic picture of small-scale dynamo in the cluster plasma and attempt to reconcile it with the existence of plasma instabilities at collisionless scales.},

We determine the time evolution of the pressure agyrotropy and discuss how the propagation of “magnetoelastic perturbations” can affect the pressure tensor anisotropization and its spatial filamentation, which are due to the action of both the magnetic field and the flow strain tensor.

We observe the spectra of velocity, solenoidal pressure component, density and temperatures all exhibiting the k−5/3k−5/3k{\textasciicircum}\{-5/3\} scaling in the inertial range. The Helmholtz decomposition results reveal that the solenoidal velocity component predominates over the dilatational component. Fluctuations of the solenoidal velocity and pressure components are nearly insensitive to the turbulent Mach number and vibrational relaxation, while those of the dilatational velocity and pressure components are closely related to them. In addition, the weak and strong acoustic equilibrium hypotheses are verified. On global average, the dissipation of translational–rotational energy fluctuation stems mainly from the thermal conduction and vibrational relaxation, while effects of the dilatation and viscosity are negligible. For the vibrational energy fluctuation, the dilatation effect is insignificant, while the dissipation due to the thermal conduction is roughly equivalent to the production owing to the vibrational relaxation. The cascades of translational–rotational and vibrational energy fluctuations are mainly dominated by the solenoidal component of filtered velocity. The direct subgrid-scale (SGS) fluxes of translational–rotational and vibrational energy fluctuations due to the dilatational component of filtered velocity in the compression region are balanced by the reverse SGS fluxes in the expansion region. On the other hand, the dependencies of the SGS fluxes due to the solenoidal component of filtered velocity on the local compressibility are closely related to the relaxation effect. The sensibility gradually disappears as the relaxation effect weakens.},

Starting with the Mariners, for more than ﬁve decades, multiple space missions have enabled in-depth studies of solar wind turbulence. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) was launched to explore the origins and evolution of the solar wind. With its state-of-the-art instrumentation and unprecedented close approaches to the sun, PSP is starting a new era of inner heliospheric exploration. In this review we discuss observations of turbulent energy ﬂow across scales in the inner heliosphere as observed by PSP. After providing a quick theoretical overview and a quick recap of turbulence before PSP, we discuss in detail the observations of energy at various scales on its journey from the largest scales to the internal degrees of freedom of the plasma. We conclude with some open ended questions, many of which we hope that PSP will help answer.},

	abstract = {We revisit the problem of how energy transfer through the turbulent cascade operates in compressible hydrodynamic turbulence. In general, there is no conservative compressible cascade since the kinetic and internal energy reservoirs can exchange energy through pressure dilatation. Moreover, statistically stationary turbulence at high Mach number can only be maintained in nearly isothermal gas, i.e., if excess heat produced by shock compression and kinetic energy dissipation is continuously removed from the system. We mimic this process by a linear cooling term in numerical simulations of turbulence driven by stochastic forcing. This allows us to investigate turbulence statistics for a broad range of Mach numbers. We compute the rate of change of kinetic and internal energy in wavenumber shells caused by advective, compressive, and pressure dilatation effects and constrain power-law fits to compressible turbulence energy spectra to a range of wavenumbers in which the total energy transfer is close to zero. The resulting scaling exponents are significantly affected by the forcing. Depending on the root mean square Mach number, we find a nearly constant advective component of the cross-scale flux of kinetic energy at intermediate wavenumbers for particular mixtures of solenoidal and compressive modes in the forcing. This suggests the existence of a natural, Mach number dependent mixture of forcing modes. Our findings also support an advection-dominated regime at high Mach numbers with specific scaling exponents (Burgers scaling for the pure velocity fluctuation \$u\$ and Kolmogorov scaling for the mass-weighted variable \$v={\textbackslash}rho{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}u\$).},

	abstract = {Observed turbulence in space and astrophysics is expected to involve cascade and subsequent dissipation and heating. Contrary to standard collisional ﬂuid turbulence, the weakly collisional magnetized plasma cascade may involve several channels of energy conversion, interchange, and spatial transport, leading eventually to the production of internal energy. This paper describes these channels of transfer and conversion, collectively amounting to a complex generalization of the Kolmogorov cascade. Channels may be described using compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and multispecies Vlasov–Maxwell formulations. Key steps are conservative transport of energy in space, parallel incompressible and compressible cascades in scale, electromagnetic work on particles driving macroscopic and microscopic ﬂows, and pressure–strain interactions, both compressive and shear-like, that produce internal energy. A signiﬁcant contrast with the collisional case is that the steps leading to the disappearance of large-scale energy in favor of internal energy are formally reversible. This property motivates a discussion of entropy, reversibility, and the relationship between dissipation with collisions and in the Vlasov system without collisions. Where feasible, examples are given from MHD and Particle in Cell simulations and from MMS observations.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the turbulent cascade of magnetic energy in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on the assumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wave number space, critical balance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, and the applicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent plasma. The model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving scale in the MHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into the kinetic Alfvén wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes. The turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent fluctuations, k∥ ≪ k⊥ (implied by critical balance). In this limit, the turbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown that the gyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar wind parameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic Alfvén wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions under which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are established. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides a natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the dissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is predicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in observations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The cascade model is motivated by a program of gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence and particle heating in the solar wind.},

	title = {Cascades of temperature and entropy ﬂuctuations in compressible turbulence},
	abstract = {Cascades of temperature and entropy ﬂuctuations are studied by numerical simulations of stationary three-dimensional compressible turbulence with a heat source. The ﬂuctuation spectra of velocity, compressible velocity component, density and pressure exhibit the −5/3 scaling in an inertial range. The strong acoustic equilibrium relation between spectra of the compressible velocity component and pressure is observed. The −5/3 scaling behaviour is also identiﬁed for the ﬂuctuation spectra of temperature and entropy, with the Obukhov–Corrsin constants close to that of a passive scalar spectrum. It is shown by Kovasznay decomposition that the dynamics of the temperature ﬁeld is dominated by the entropic mode. The average subgrid-scale (SGS) ﬂuxes of temperature and entropy normalized by the total dissipation rates are close to 1 in the inertial range. The cascade of temperature is dominated by the compressible mode of the velocity ﬁeld, indicating that the theory of a passive scalar in incompressible turbulence is not suitable to describe the inter-scale transfer of temperature in compressible turbulence. In contrast, the cascade of entropy is dominated by the solenoidal mode of the velocity ﬁeld. The different behaviours of cascades of temperature and entropy are partly explained by the geometrical properties of SGS ﬂuxes. Moreover, the different effects of local compressibility on the SGS ﬂuxes of temperature and entropy are investigated by conditional averaging with respect to the ﬁltered dilatation, demonstrating that the effect of compressibility on the cascade of temperature is much stronger than on the cascade of entropy.},

The velocity field is decomposed into a solenoidal component and a compressible component in terms of the Helmholtz decomposition, and the compressible velocity component is further decomposed into a pseudosound component, namely, the hydrodynamic component associated with the incompressible field and an acoustic component associated with sound waves. It is found that the acoustic mode dominates over the pseudosound mode at turbulent Mach numbers Mt≥0.4 in our numerical simulations. At turbulent Mach numbers Mt≤0.4, there exists a critical wave number kc beyond which the pseudosound mode dominates while the acoustic mode dominates at small wave numbers k{\textless}kc. In the pseudosound-mode-dominated region, the compressible velocity is fully enslaved to the solenoidal velocity, and its spectrum scales as M4tk−3 in the inertial range. It is also found that in the inertial range, the spectra of pressure, density, and temperature exhibit a k−7/3 scaling for Mt≤0.3 and a k−5/3 scaling for Mt≥0.5.},

	abstract = {Kinetic energy transfer in compressible homogeneous anisotropic turbulence is studied by numerical simulations of forced anisotropic turbulence (FAT) in a periodic box and homogeneous shear turbulence (HST) at different turbulent Mach numbers Mt and different Taylor Reynolds numbers Reλ. In both FAT and HST, the subgrid-scale (SGS) kinetic energy flux is dominated by the streamwise component at large scales, and tends to be isotropic at small scales. As the turbulent Mach number increases, the compressibility slightly enhances the anisotropy of SGS kinetic energy flux and viscous dissipation. The redistribution of kinetic energy from the streamwise direction to two transverse directions by pressure-strain mainly occurs at large length scales. The kinetic energy transferred from the streamwise component through the pressure-strain is shared unequally by the other two components in HST, which is different from the situation of FAT. In FAT, as the Taylor Reynolds number increases, the total SGS kinetic energy flux and its positive and negative components tend to a Reynolds number asymptotic state at small scales for Reλ≥105. In HST, the positive vertical SGS flux of kinetic energy is significantly enhanced by compression motions, causing the vertical SGS flux component to be larger than the streamwise component at small scales. The interscale energy transfer of the solenoidal mode and dilatational mode is studied by employing Helmholtz decomposition. The dilatational kinetic energy of FAT is nearly isotropic, but that of HST is significantly anisotropic. In HST, the dilatational mode obtains energy not only from the solenoidal mode through nonlinear advection, but also from mean shear by the dilatational production. As the turbulent Mach number increases, the nonlinear advection of HST increases first and then decreases. The dilatational production of HST increases monotonically with the turbulent Mach number, providing the main source of kinetic energy to the dilatational mode at high turbulent Mach number Mt≥0.46.},

The Hall term is shown to bring ion-scale corrections to the exact law without affecting explicitly the pressure terms. In the pressure isotropy limit we recover all known results obtained for isothermal and polytropic closures. The incompressible limit of the gyrotropic system leads to a generalization of the Politano and Pouquet's law where a new incompressible source term is revealed and reflects exchanges of the magnetic and kinetic energies with the no-longer-conserved internal energy. We highlight the possibilities offered by the new laws to investigate potential links between turbulence cascade and instabilities widely observed in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.},

This paper begins an effort to better understand solar wind turbulence from 1 to 45 au while spanning greater than one solar cycle. We first focus on the diagnostics marking the onset of dissipation. This includes an expected break in the power spectrum at frequencies greater than the proton cyclotron frequency and a resultant steepening of the spectrum at higher frequencies. Contrary to what is established at 1 au, we only see the spectral break in rare instances. The expected scaling of the spectral index with the turbulence rate is seen, but it is not as clearly established as it was at 1 au. We also find that both Voyager data from 1 to 45 au and Advanced Composition Explorer data from 1 au show significant bias of the magnetic helicity at dissipation scales when the dissipation-range power-law spectral index steepens. We conclude that dissipation dynamics are similar throughout the heliosphere in so far as we have examined to date.},

The magnetic fluctuation anisotropy as it relates to the compressive component is directly dependent upon both the plasma beta of the thermal proton component and the ratio of magnetic fluctuation magnitude to the strength of the mean magnetic field. This has been seen before at 1 au. The magnetic fluctuation anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, which is a measure of the anisotropy of the underlying wavevector distribution, should depend on the angle between the mean magnetic field and the radial direction and should be confined to values between one and the index of the power spectrum, which is typically 5/3. Our results show that the average of this anisotropy exceeds the value of the spectral index and is out of bounds with the theory. Although the results are suggestive of past analyses, we find that spherical expansion of the turbulence may offer at least a partial explanation of the apparent amplification of this measured anisotropy.},

In the process, we compute magnetic spectra for 839 data intervals spanning the range from 1 to 35 au when thermal ion data is available and use those spectra to obtain independent estimates for the energy cascade rates at intermediate scales that we assume equals the rate of thermal proton heating by the turbulence. We compare three analyses that describe different aspects of the solar wind heating problem: the rate of energy cascade through the intermediate scales of the magnetic spectrum, the rate at which energy is supplied to that cascade from the large-scale fluctuations as described by magnetohydrodynamic transport theory, and the rate at which energy is injected into the spectrum via wave excitation by newborn interstellar ions.

During this time the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft reached 43.5 and 33.6 au, respectively. The use of daily spectrograms permits us to perform a thorough search of the data. We have identified 637 different data intervals that show evidence of waves excited by either pickup He+, H+, or both, and these intervals extend to the furthest distances in the years studied. To compare wave features against more typical interplanetary observations, we also employ 1675 data intervals spanning the same years that do not contain wave signatures and use these as control intervals. While the majority of wave events display the classic spectral characteristics of waves due to PUIs, including left-hand polarization in the spacecraft frame, a significant number of the events are right-hand polarized in the spacecraft frame. We have no complete explanation for this result, but we do show that right-handed waves are seen when the local magnetic field is nonradial.},

	abstract = {Voyager 1 (V1) has been exploring the heliospheric boundary layer in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) since 2012 August. The measurements revealed a spectrum of fluctuations over a vast range of space and timescales, but the nature of these fluctuations continues to be an intriguing question. Numerous manifestations of turbulence cannot be explained using a single phenomenology. Weak shocks and compressions are the prominent features of the VLISM. We use high-resolution (48 s) measurements to perform a multiscale analysis of turbulence at V1 between the years of 2013.36 and 2019.0 (124–144 au from the Sun). On relatively large scales, wave trains of mixed compressible/transverse nature with the correlation scale in the range of 15–100 days dominate the spectrum of fluctuations. The observed magnetic field profiles are suggestive of a Burgers-like (f−2) turbulence phenomenology induced by solar activity. We demonstrate that the level of large-scale compressible fluctuations is still significant in late 2018. We analyze the turbulence down to small scales comparable to the ion inertial length and show that magnetic compressibility is always large on these scales. Besides the shock-induced turbulence measured from 2014.486, the intensity and intermittency of small-scale fluctuations have been growing smoothly since 2018.5. Our analysis suggests that local processes are contributing to the production of turbulence on small scales. We present the estimates of transport coefficients in the plasma traversed by V1. The range of scales is identified where V1 measurements are affected by the contribution from pickup ions.},

	abstract = {We present results from three-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations of Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence in a high-beta, collisionless plasma. The key feature of such turbulence is the interplay between local wave-wave interactions between the fluctuations in the cascade and the non-local wave-particle interactions associated with kinetic micro-instabilities driven by anisotropy in the thermal pressure (namely, firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron). We present theoretical estimates for, and calculate directly from the simulations, the effective collisionality and plasma viscosity in pressure-anisotropic high-beta turbulence, demonstrating that, for strong Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence, the effective parallel viscous scale is comparable to the driving scale of the cascade. Most of the cascade energy (80-90\%) is dissipated as ion heating through a combination of Landau damping and anisotropic viscous heating. The kinetic-energy spectrum of the turbulence has a slope steeper than \$-5/3\$ due to the anisotropic viscous stress. The magnetic-energy spectrum is shallower than \$-5/3\$ near the ion-Larmor scale due to fluctuations produced by the firehose instability. Our results have implications for models of particle heating in low-luminosity accretion onto supermassive black holes, the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium, and the interpretation of near-Earth solar-wind observations.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent aspects of solar wind physics and elucidates the role Alfvén waves play in solar wind acceleration and turbulence, which prevail in the low corona and inner heliosphere. Our understanding of the solar wind has made considerable progress based on remote sensing, in situ measurements, kinetic simulation and fluid modeling. Further insights are expected from such missions as the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.
The sources of the solar wind have been identified in the chromospheric network, transition region and corona of the Sun. Alfvén waves excited by reconnection in the network contribute to the driving of turbulence and plasma flows in funnels and coronal holes. The dynamic solar magnetic field causes solar wind variations over the solar cycle. Fast and slow solar wind streams, as well as transient coronal mass ejections, are generated by the Sun's magnetic activity.
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence originates at the Sun and evolves into interplanetary space. The major Alfvén waves and minor magnetosonic waves, with an admixture of pressure-balanced structures at various scales, constitute heliophysical turbulence. Its spectra evolve radially and develop anisotropies. Numerical simulations of turbulence spectra have reproduced key observational features. Collisionless dissipation of fluctuations remains a subject of intense research.
Detailed measurements of particle velocity distributions have revealed non-Maxwellian electrons, strongly anisotropic protons and heavy ion beams. Besides macroscopic forces in the heliosphere, local wave–particle interactions shape the distribution functions. They can be described by the Boltzmann–Vlasov equation including collisions and waves. Kinetic simulations permit us to better understand the combined evolution of particles and waves in the heliosphere.},

	abstract = {In Part 2 of our guide to collisionless fluid models, we concentrate on Landau fluid closures. These closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless Landau damping into a fluid framework. It is Landau damping that sharply separates traditional fluid models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual fluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the long-wavelength low-frequency limit. We start with a brief introduction to kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function

              . We then consider a one-dimensional (1-D) (electrostatic) geometry and make a significant effort to map all possible Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the fourth-order moment level. These closures for parallel moments have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and electron) Landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau damping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed by considering 1-D closures at higher-order moments than the fourth order, and as was concluded in Part 1, this is not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired precision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic descriptions. We then consider a 3-D (electromagnetic) geometry in the gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are available at the fourth-order moment level. In appendix A, we provide comprehensive tables with Padé approximants of

	abstract = {This paper analyses the turbulent energy cascade from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and relates inter-scale energy ﬂuxes to statistical irreversibility and informationentropy production. The microscopical reversibility of the energy cascade is tested by constructing a reversible 3D turbulent system using a dynamic model for the sub-grid stresses. This system, when reversed in time, develops a sustained inverse cascade towards the large scales, evidencing that the characterisation of the inertial energy cascade must consider the possibility of an inverse regime. This experiment is used to study the origin of statistical irreversibility and the prevalence of direct over inverse energy cascades in isotropic turbulence. Statistical irreversibility, a property of statistical ensembles in phase space related to entropy production, is connected to the dynamics of the energy cascade in physical space by considering the space locality of the energy ﬂuxes and their relation to the local structure of the ﬂow. A mechanism to explain the probabilistic prevalence of direct energy transfer is proposed based the dynamics of the rate-of-strain tensor, which is identiﬁed as the most important source of statistical irreversibility in the energy cascade.},

Preliminary fully nonlinear simulations were performed in two space dimensions to address the heating of the plasma by Alfv´enic turbulence, leading to the formation of mirror structures, a result consistent with previously performed one-dimensional simulations. In three space dimensions, the ﬁlamentation of a large-scale Alfv´en wave propagating in a low-density channel was simulated. In the fully nonlinear regime where the magnetic ﬁeld lines are strongly distorted, speciﬁc diﬃculties of the multidimensional problem have been pointed out at the level of the electron Landau damping.

When applied to measured data, our global-in-scale theory can deduce the energy transfer rates using the full range of data, therefore it has broader applications compared with the local theories, especially in situations where the data is imperfect. In addition, because of the resolution of forcing scales, the new theory can detect the scales of energy input, which was impossible before.

	abstract = {Plasmas whose Coulomb-collision rates are very small may relax on shorter time scales to non-Maxwellian quasi-equilibria, which, nevertheless, have a universal form, with dependence on initial conditions retained only via an infinite set of Casimir invariants enforcing phase-volume conservation. These are distributions derived by Lynden-Bell (1967) via a statistical-mechanical entropy-maximisation procedure, assuming perfect mixing of phase-space elements. To show that these equilibria are reached dynamically, one must derive an effective `collisionless collision integral' for which they are fixed points -- unique and inevitable provided the integral has an appropriate H-theorem. We describe how such collision integrals are derived and what assumptions are required for them to have a closed form, how to prove the H-theorems for them, and why, for a system carrying sufficiently large electric-fluctuation energy, collisionless relaxation should be fast. It is suggested that collisionless dynamics may favour maximising entropy locally in phase space before converging to global maximum-entropy states. Relaxation due to interspecies interaction is examined, leading, inter alia, to spontaneous transient generation of electron currents. The formalism also allows efficient recovery of `true' collision integrals for both classical and quantum plasmas.},

Modern theories of plasma turbulence are based on the fundamental concept that the turbulent cascade of energy is caused by the nonlinear interaction between counterpropagating Alfvén waves, yet this interaction has never been observationally or experimentally verified. We present here the first experimental measurement in a laboratory plasma of the nonlinear interaction between counterpropagating Alfvén waves, the fundamental building block of astrophysical plasma turbulence. This measurement establishes a firm basis for the application of theoretical ideas developed in idealized models to turbulence in realistic space and astrophysical plasma systems.},

For a polytropic index of γ=5/3 ({\textgreater}1), entropy increases with distance due to the dissipation of turbulence, being about 12.84\% higher at 75 au than at 1 au. However, if the polytropic index satisﬁes γ{\textless}1, entropy decreases. We show that not only the creation of pickup ions, but also stream-shear leads to a decrease of the solar wind speed. We show that the sum of the solar wind ﬂow energy (kinetic plus enthalpy) and turbulent (magnetic) energy is constant, indicating that kinetic solar wind energy is transferred into turbulent energy via stream-shear and pickup ion isotropization, which then in turn heats the solar wind via the dissipation of turbulence. We compare the theoretical solutions of the solar wind entropy, the solar wind density, the thermal gas pressure, the solar wind proton temperature, and the ﬂuctuating magnetic energy with those measured by Voyager 2. The results show that the theoretical results are in good agreement with the observed results.},

We use {\textasciitilde}92-s datasets of proton plasma moments (speed, density, and temperature), measured from the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard Wind spacecraft, to estimate the moving averages of the polytropic index, as well as their weighted means and standard errors as a function of the solar wind speed and the year of measurements. The derived long-term behavior of the polytropic index agrees with the results of other previous methods. In particular, we ﬁnd that the polytropic index remains quasi-constant with respect to the plasma ﬂow speed, in agreement with earlier analyses of solar wind plasma. It is shown that most of the ﬂuctuations of the polytropic index appear in the fast solar wind. The polytropic index remains quasi-constant, despite the frequent entropic variations. Therefore, on an annual basis, the polytropic index of the solar wind proton plasma near {\textasciitilde}1 AU can be considered independent of the plasma ﬂow speed.

	abstract = {The Solar Wind is a turbulent plasma whose internal physics has been extensively studied for years through theoretical models, plasma simulations and in situ satellite observations. Understanding the mechanisms hidden behind turbulence energy dissipation is a key step in unraveling the mysteries of the solar wind.In this thesis we first derive new Hall MHD turbulence exact laws, theoretical tools that allow for the calculation of the turbulence energy cascade rate. We develop a program able to compute these laws on 3D simulation datasets, and apply it to a variety of direct numerical simulations of different plasma models. On the one hand, these studies allow us to prove the consistency between the different exact laws existing for a same model and to better understand their detailed behavior. On the other hand, they yield important physical results: the study of Landau-fluid datasets allows us to partly reconcile the fluid and kinetic description of plasmas, justifying the analysis of solar wind energy dissipation through fluid exact laws, and the study of strongly supersonic datasets hints at turbulence playing a key role on the formation of star-forming interstellar filaments.These individual studies are then complemented by the analysis of in situ data measured by MMS in the magnetosheath. The application of the compressible exact laws to these data unveils the odd behavior of the methods used to compute 3D fields derivatives using MMS four satellites. An in-depth investigation of this method, both using MMS data and simulation data through the use of a virtual spacecraft, reveal important errors induced by this method in the calculation of exact laws. These new insights could help preparing future multipoint and multi-scale space missions targeting solar wind turbulence.},

The model includes a limit on the proton temperature anisotropy based upon thresholds for onset of the ion cyclotron and mirror instabilities. Results are presented for three different values of the isotropization rate. The model shows the existence of the plasma depletion layer, corresponding to an increase of the magnetic field intensity and a decrease of the plasma density near the magnetopause, for all angles of the bow shock normal relative to the interplanetary magnetic field. There is a thin layer downstream of the quasi-parallel shock where T‖p {\textgreater} T⊥p.

	abstract = {Using high-resolution data from Solar Orbiter, we investigate the plasma conditions necessary for the proton temperature anisotropy driven mirror-mode and oblique ﬁrehose instabilities to occur in the solar wind. We ﬁnd that the unstable plasma exhibits dependencies on the angle between the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and the bulk solar wind velocity which cannot be explained by the double-adiabatic expansion of the solar wind alone. The angle dependencies suggest that perpendicular heating in Alfv´enic wind may be responsible. We quantify the occurrence rate of the two instabilities as a function of the length of unstable intervals as they are convected over the spacecraft. This analysis indicates that mirror-mode and oblique ﬁrehose instabilities require a spatial interval of length greater than 2 to 3 unstable wavelengths in order to relax the plasma into a marginally stable state and thus closer to thermodynamic equilibrium in the solar wind. Our analysis suggests that the conditions for these instabilities to act eﬀectively vary locally on scales much shorter than the correlation length of solar wind turbulence.},

	abstract = {The third-order scaling law, Yaglom law, of Elsässer fluctuations in the solar wind is believed to reflect the inertial range energy cascade of the MHD turbulence and provides an approach to evaluate the cascade rate. However, the occurrence ratio with the Yaglom scaling law, the fraction of the intervals where the Yaglom linear scaling is observed, is reported to be low (0.05–0.30) in the high-latitude solar wind observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. Whether the occurrence ratio could be higher in other conditions remains unknown. Here, we analyze the occurrence of the third-order scaling in the inner heliosphere with the first 100 days of observation of the Helios 1 and Helios 2 spacecraft. We investigate 162 intervals in the leading edges and 323 intervals in the trailing edges of the high-speed streams, respectively. All of these intervals have a time duration of 9 hr. We find that in the inner heliosphere the occurrence ratio is relatively high in the leading edges (0.58) and moderate in the trailing edges (0.45). Among the data intervals with the Yaglom scaling in the leading edges, 94.7\% of intervals give positive rates, while in the trailing edges 78.6\% give negative rates. The variations of the occurrence ratio with various turbulence parameters are shown. The cascade rate is found to be higher than the proton heating rate calculated from the data, which have third-order scaling. These new results raise several questions related to the nature and origin of the third-order scaling law and may initiate new studies on solar wind turbulence.},

Using the Cluster/STAFF instrument, we make a survey of the power spectral density and of the polarization of these ﬂuctuations at frequencies f ∈ [1, 400] Hz, during ﬁve years (2001–2005), when Cluster was in the free solar wind. In ∼10\% of the selected data, we observe narrowband, right-handed, circularly polarized ﬂuctuations, with wave vectors quasi-parallel to the mean magnetic ﬁeld, superimposed on the spectrum of the permanent background turbulence. We interpret these coherent ﬂuctuations as whistler mode waves. The lifetime of these waves varies between a few seconds and several hours. Here, we present, for the ﬁrst time, an analysis of long-lived whistler waves, i.e., lasting more than ﬁve minutes. We ﬁnd several necessary (but not sufﬁcient) conditions for the observation of whistler waves, mainly a low level of background turbulence, a slow wind, a relatively large electron heat ﬂux, and a low electron collision frequency. When the electron parallel beta factor βe is larger than 3, the whistler waves are seen along the heat ﬂux threshold of the whistler heat ﬂux instability. The presence of such whistler waves conﬁrms that the whistler heat ﬂux instability contributes to the regulation of the solar wind heat ﬂux, at least for βe 3, in slow wind at 1 AU.},

To capture and quantify turbulence properties, we apply the Karman–Howarth–Monin (KHM) equation for compressible Hall–MHD (extended by considering the plasma pressure as a tensor quantity) to the numerical results. The KHM analysis indicates that the transition from MHD to ion scales (the so-called ion break in the power spectrum) results from a combination of an onset of Hall physics and an effective dissipation owing to the pressure–strain energy-exchange channel and resistivity.

If these non-equilibrium features are sufﬁciently strong, they drive kinetic micro-instabilities. We develop a semi-graphical framework based on the equations of quasi-linear theory to describe electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind. We apply our framework to resonant instabilities driven by temperature anisotropies. These include the electron whistler anisotropy instability and the propagating electron ﬁrehose instability. We then describe resonant instabilities driven by reﬂectional asymmetries in the electron distribution function. These include the electron/ion-acoustic, kinetic Alfvén heat-ﬂux, Langmuir, electron-beam, electron/ion-cyclotron, electron/ electron-acoustic, whistler heat-ﬂux, oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler, lower-hybrid fan, and electron-deﬁcit whistler instability. We brieﬂy comment on non-resonant instabilities driven by electron temperature anisotropies such as the mirror-mode and the non-propagating ﬁrehose instability.

Correlation lengths are grouped by an interval’s alignment angle; the angle between the magnetic-field and solar wind velocity vectors (ΘBV). Parallel and perpendicular angular channels correspond to angles 0° {\textless} ΘBV {\textless} 40° and 50° {\textless} ΘBV {\textless} 90°, respectively. We observe an anisotropy in the inner heliosphere within 0.40 au, with at 0.10 au. This anisotropy reduces with increasing heliocentric distance and the correlation lengths roughly isotropize within 1 au. Results from ACE and WIND support a reversal of the anisotropy, such that at 1 au. The ratio does not appear to change significantly beyond 1 au, although the small number of parallel intervals in the Voyager data set precludes unambiguous conclusions from being drawn. This study provides insights regarding the radial evolution of the large, most energetic interacting turbulent fluctuations in the heliosphere. We also emphasize the importance of tracking the changes in sampling direction in PSP measurements as the spacecraft approaches the Sun, when using these data to study the radial evolution of turbulence. This can prove to be vital in understanding the more complex dynamics of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere and can assist in improving related simulations.},

In this letter, we show that the rates obtained by such an approach strongly depend on the rather arbitrary choice one makes for these model functions. An alternative approach, consisting in monitoring the radial evolution of the adiabatic invariants, based on locally and consistently measured plasma and magnetic field parameters, is free from such a flaw. We apply this technique to a recently released Helios proton dataset, and confirm the existence of a clear perpendicular heating of solar wind's protons. On the other hand, no significant change in the parallel adiabatic invariant is visible in the data. We conclude that to date, and in the distance range of 0.3 to 1 AU, no clear observation of a deviation of solar wind's protons from parallel adiabaticity has ever been made.},

The term has been written as a sum of the pressure dilatation and the collisionless analogue of viscous heating referred to as Pi − D, which isolates the power density due to compressible and incompressible eﬀects, respectively. It has been shown that Pi − D can be negative, which makes its identiﬁcation as collisionless viscous heating troubling. We argue that an alternate decomposition of pressure-strain interaction can be useful for interpreting the underlying physics. Since Pi − D contains both normal deformation and shear deformation, we propose grouping the normal deformation with the pressure dilatation to describe the power density due to converging/diverging ﬂows, with the balance describing the power density purely due to shear deformation. We then develop a kinetic theory interpretation of compression, normal deformation, and shear deformation. We use the results to determine the physical mechanisms that can make Pi − D negative. We argue that both decompositions can be useful for the study of energy conversion in weakly collisional or collisionless ﬂuids and plasmas, and implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {In weakly collisional and collisionless magnetized plasmas, the pressure-strain interaction describes the rate of conversion between bulk ﬂow and thermal energy density. In this study, we derive an analytical expression for the pressure-strain interaction in a coordinate system with an axis aligned with the local magnetic ﬁeld. The result is eight groups of terms corresponding to diﬀerent physical mechanisms that can contribute to the pressure-strain interaction. We provide a physical description of each term. The results are immediately of interest to weakly collisional and collisionless magnetized plasmas and the fundamental processes that happen therein, including magnetic reconnection, magnetized plasma turbulence, and collisionless shocks. The terms in the ﬁeld-aligned coordinate decomposition are likely accessible to measurement with satellite observations.},

Varying the nature of the initial conditions (magnitudes of velocity and magnetic ﬂuctuations), and initial Mach numbers permits examination of various dynamical regimes characterized here by the changes between different energy reservoirs. Acoustic waves are responsible for the oscillatory exchange between compressive kinetic and thermal energy through the pressure dilatation term. The results indicate that exchange between kinetic and magnetic energy is dominated by interactions involving the solenoidal velocity.

We compare several energy dissipation estimates based on energy transfer processes in plasma turbulence and provide justiﬁcation for the pressure–strain interaction as a direct estimate of the energy dissipation rate. The global and scale-by-scale energy balances are examined in 2.5D and 3D kinetic simulations. We show that the global internal energy increase and the temperature enhancement of each species are directly tracked by the pressure–strain interaction. The incompressive part of the pressure–strain interaction dominates over its compressive part in all simulations considered. The scale-by-scale energy balance is quantiﬁed by scale ﬁltered Vlasov–Maxwell equations, a kinetic plasma approach, and the lag dependent von Kármán–Howarth equation, an approach based on ﬂuid models. We ﬁnd that the energy balance is exactly satisﬁed across all scales, but the lack of a well-deﬁned inertial range inﬂuences the distribution of the energy budget among different terms in the inertial range. Therefore, the widespread use of the Yaglom relation in estimating the dissipation rate is questionable in some cases, especially when the scale separation in the system is not clearly deﬁned. In contrast, the pressure–strain interaction balances exactly the dissipation rate at kinetic scales regardless of the scale separation.},

This question is examined through the lens of circulicity, a concept related to the angular momentum carried by large turbulent scales. By deriving a Monin-Yaglom relation for circulicity, we show that an “effective” cascade of this quantity exists, provided the flow is stirred with a force having a solenoidal component. This outcome is obtained independently from the expression of the equation of state. To supplement these results, a coarse-graining analysis of the flow is performed. This approach allows us to separate the contributions of the transfer and production terms of circulicity and to discuss their respective effects in the inertial range.},

Using three sets of cross-scale simulations where turbulence is initiated at large, medium, and small scales, the ability of the fluid energy cascade to “sense” the kinetic Landau damping at different scales is tested. The cascade rate estimated from the exact law and the dissipation calculated directly from the simulation are shown to reflect the role of Landau damping in dissipating energy at all scales, with an emphasis on the kinetic ones. This result provides new prospects on using exact laws for simplified fluid models to analyze dissipation in kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations, and new insights into theoretical description of collisionless magnetized plasmas.},

Here we propose a more general method that allows us to obtain such laws for any turbulent isentropic flow (i.e., constant entropy). We demonstrate that the known MHD exact laws (incompressible and isothermal) and the new (polytropic) one can be obtained as specific cases of the general law when the corresponding closure equation is stated. We also recover all known exact laws of hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence (incompressible, isothermal, and polytropic) from this law in the limit B = 0. We furthermore show that the difference between the two forms (isothermal and polytropic) of the MHD exact laws of interest in this work resides in some of the source terms and in the explicit form of the flux term that depends on internal energy. Finally, we apply these two forms to Parker Solar Probe data taken in the inner heliosphere to highlight how the different closure equations affect the energy cascade rate estimates.},

	abstract = {One characteristic trait of space plasmas is the multi-scale dynamics resulting from non-linear transfers and conversions of various forms of energy. Routinely evidenced in a range from the large-scale solar structures down to the characteristic scales of ions and electrons, turbulence is a major cross-scale energy transfer mechanism in space plasmas. At intermediate scales, the fate of the energy in the outer space is mainly determined by the interplay of turbulent motions and propagating waves. More mechanisms are advocated to account for the transfer and conversion of energy, including magnetic reconnection, emission of radiation and particle energization, all contributing to make the dynamical state of solar and heliospheric plasmas difficult to predict. The characterization of the energy transfer in space plasmas benefited from numerous robotic missions. However, together with breakthrough technologies, novel theoretical developments and methodologies for the analysis of data played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of how energy is transferred across the scales in the space. In recent decades, several scaling laws were obtained providing effective ways to model the energy flux in turbulent plasmas. Under certain assumptions, these relations enabled to utilize reduced knowledge (in terms of degrees of freedom) of the fields from spacecraft observations to obtain direct estimates of the energy transfer rates (and not only) in the interplanetary space, also in the proximity of the Sun and planets. Starting from the first third-order exact law for the magnetohydrodynamics by Politano and Pouquet (1998), we present a detailed review of the main scaling laws for the energy transfer in plasma turbulence and their application, presenting theoretical, numerical and observational milestones of what has become one of the main approaches for the characterization of turbulent dynamics and energetics in space plasmas.},

	abstract = {Various exact laws governing compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and compressible Hall-MHD (CHMHD) turbulence have been derived in recent years. Other than their fundamental theoretical interest, these laws are generally used to estimate the energy dissipation rate from spacecraft observations in order to address diverse problems related, e.g., to heating of the solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas. Here we use various 10243 direct numerical simulation data of free-decay isothermal CHMHD turbulence obtained with the GHOST code (Geophysical High-Order Suite for Turbulence) to analyze two of the recently derived exact laws. The simulations reﬂect different intensities of the initial Mach number and the background magnetic ﬁeld. The analysis demonstrates the equivalence of the two laws in the inertial range and relates the strength of the Hall effect to the amplitude of the cascade rate at sub-ion scales. When taken in their general form (i.e., not limited to the inertial range), some subtleties regarding the validity of the stationarity assumption or the absence of the forcing in the simulations are discussed. We show that the free-decay nature of the turbulence induces a shift from a large-scale forcing toward the presence of a scale-dependent reservoir of energy fueling the cascade or dissipation. The reduced form of the exact laws (valid in the inertial range) ultimately holds even if the stationarity assumption is not fully veriﬁed.},

While we understand the possible mechanisms that may generate these distributions in these plasmas, the thermodynamic origin of these distributions remains a challenge: Particle systems at thermal equilibrium are known to be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, but it is unknown whether this distribution is unique or other distribution functions consistent with thermodynamics may exist. This paper resolves the thermodynamic origin of kappa distributions. For particle systems eventually reaching thermal equilibrium, we show: i) the existence of two thermodynamic integrals characterizing thermal equilibrium, corresponding to two independent intensive thermodynamic quantities, temperature and kappa index (parameter labelling kappa distributions); ii) the adaptation of Sackur-Tetrode entropy for kappa distributions with applications in solar wind plasma; iii) the pseudo-additivity rule of entropy; iv) that the most general, physically meaningful, distribution function that particle systems are stabilized into when reaching thermal equilibrium is the kappa distribution.},

In the absence of a mean field , is expected to be isotropic (radial) and independent of the direction of increments, so its measure yields directly the cascade rate. For turbulence with mean field, as in the solar wind, is expected to become more two-dimensional (2D), that is, to have larger perpendicular components, losing the above simple symmetry. To get the cascade rate, one should compute the flux of , which is not feasible with single-spacecraft data; thus, measurements rely on assumptions about the unknown symmetry. We use direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to characterize the anisotropy of . We find that for strong guide field the degree of two-dimensionalization depends on the relative importance of shear-Alfvén and pseudo-Alfvén polarizations (the two components of an Alfvén mode in incompressible MHD). The anisotropy also shows up in the inertial range. The more is 2D, the more the inertial range extent differs along parallel and perpendicular directions. We finally test the two methods employed in observations and find that the so-obtained cascade rate may depend on the angle between B0 and the direction of increments. Both methods yield a vanishing cascade rate along the parallel direction, contrary to observations, suggesting a weaker anisotropy of solar wind turbulence compared to our DNSs. This could be due to a weaker mean field and/or to solar wind expansion.},

	abstract = {One of the main benchmarks in direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional turbulence is the Kolmogorov prediction for third-order structure functions with homogeneous and isotropic statistics in the infinite Reynolds number limit. Previous direct numerical simulations (DNS) techniques to obtain isotropic statistics have relied on time-averaging structure functions in a few directions over many eddy-turnover times, using forcing schemes carefully constructed to generate isotropic data. Motivated by recent theoretical work, which removes isotropy requirements by spherically averaging the structure functions over all directions, we will present results which supplement long-time averaging by angle-averaging over up to 73 directions from a single flow snapshot. The directions are among those natural to a square computational grid, and are weighted to approximate the spherical average. We use this angle-averaging procedure to compare the statistically steady flows generated by two different forcing schemes in a periodic box. Our results show that despite the apparent differences in the two flows, their isotropic components, as measured by the Kolmogorov laws, are essentially identical. This procedure may be used to investigate the isotropic part of the small-scale statistics of any quantity of interest. The averaging process is inexpensive, and for the Kolmogorov 4/5 law, reasonable results can be obtained from a single snapshot of data. This implies consistency with the recently derived local versions of the Kolmogorov laws, which do not require long-time averages.},

	abstract = {Solar wind is probably the best laboratory to study turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. In addition to the presence of magnetic field, the differences with neutral fluid isotropic turbulence are: (i) weakness of collisional dissipation and (ii) presence of several characteristic space and time scales. In this paper we discuss observational properties of solar wind turbulence in a large range from the MHD to the electron scales. At MHD scales, within the inertial range, turbulence cascade of magnetic fluctuations develops mostly in the plane perpendicular to the mean field, with the Kolmogorov scaling \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textasciicircum}\{-5/3\}\$for the perpendicular cascade and \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$for the parallel one. Solar wind turbulence is compressible in nature: density fluctuations at MHD scales have the Kolmogorov spectrum. Velocity fluctuations do not follow magnetic field ones: their spectrum is a power-law with a −3/2 spectral index. Probability distribution functions of different plasma parameters are not Gaussian, indicating presence of intermittency. At the moment there is no global model taking into account all these observed properties of the inertial range. At ion scales, turbulent spectra have a break, compressibility increases and the density fluctuation spectrum has a local flattening. Around ion scales, magnetic spectra are variable and ion instabilities occur as a function of the local plasma parameters. Between ion and electron scales, a small scale turbulent cascade seems to be established. It is characterized by a well defined power-law spectrum in magnetic and density fluctuations with a spectral index close to −2.8. Approaching electron scales, the fluctuations are no more self-similar: an exponential cut-off is usually observed (for time intervals without quasi-parallel whistlers) indicating an onset of dissipation. The small scale inertial range between ion and electron scales and the electron dissipation range can be together described by \${\textbackslash}sim k\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}{\textbackslash}exp(-k\_\{{\textbackslash}perp\}{\textbackslash}ell\_\{d\})\$, with α≃8/3 and the dissipation scale ℓdclose to the electron Larmor radius ℓd≃ρe. The nature of this small scale cascade and a possible dissipation mechanism are still under debate.},

	abstract = {Recently, empirical kappa distribution, commonly used to describe non-equilibrium systems like space plasmas, has been connected with non-extensive statistical mechanics. Here we show how a consistent definition of the temperature and pressure is developed for stationary states out of thermal equilibrium, so that the familiar ideal gas state equation still holds. In addition to the classical triplet of temperature, pressure, and density, this generalization requires the kappa index as a fourth independent thermodynamic variable that characterizes the non-equilibrium stationary states. All four of these thermodynamic variables have key roles in describing the governing thermodynamical processes and transitions in space plasmas. We introduce a novel characterization of isothermal and isobaric processes that describe a system's transition into different stationary states by varying the kappa index. In addition, we show how the variation of temperature or/and pressure can occur through an “iso-q” process, in which the system remains in a fixed stationary state (fixed kappa index). These processes have been detected in the proton plasma in the inner heliosheath via specialized data analysis of energetic neutral atom (ENA) observations from Interstellar Boundary Explorer. In particular, we find that the temperature is highly correlated with (1) kappa, asymptotically related to isothermal (∼1,000,000 K) and iso-q (κ ∼ 1.7) processes; and (2) density, related to an isobaric process, which separates the “Ribbon,” P ≈ 3.2 pdyn cm−2, from the globally distributed ENA flux, P ≈ 2 pdyn cm−2.},

	abstract = {Among the different astrophysical plasmas, the solar wind and the planetary magnetosheathsrepresent the best laboratories for studying the properties of fully developed plasma turbulence.Because of the relatively weak density fluctuations (∼ 10\%) in the solar wind, the low frequencyfluctuations are usually described using the incompressible MHD theory. Nevertheless, the effectof the compressibility (in particular in the fast wind) has been a subject of active research withinthe space physics community over the last three decades.My thesis is essentially dedicated to the study of compressible turbulence in different plasma environments,the planetary magnetosheaths (of Saturn and Earth) and the fast and slow solar wind.This was done using in-situ spacecraft data from the Cassini, Cluster and THEMIS/ARTEMISsatellites.I first investigated the properties of MHD and kinetic scale turbulence in the magnetosheathof Saturn using Cassini data at the MHD scales and compared them to known features of thesolar wind turbulence. This work was completed with a more detailed analysis performed in themagnetosheath of Earth using the Cluster data. Then, by applying the recently derived exactlaw of compressible isothermal MHD turbulence to the in-situ observations from THEMIS andCLUSTER spacecrafts, a detailed study regarding the effect of the compressibility on the energycascade (dissipation) rate in the fast and the slow wind is presented. Several new empirical lawsare obtained, which include the power-law scaling of the energy cascade rate as function of theturbulent Mach number. Eventually, an application of this exact model to a more compressiblemedium, the magnetosheath of Earth, using the Cluster data provides the first estimation of theenergy dissipation rate in the magnetosheath, which is found to be up to two orders of magnitudehigher than that observed in the solar wind.},

In the course of these orbits PSP will pass through widely varying conditions, including anticipated large variations of turbulence properties, such as energy density, correlation scales, and cross helicities. Here we employ global magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent turbulence transport and heating to preview conditions that will likely be encountered by PSP by assuming suitable boundary conditions at the coronal base. The code evolves large-scale parameters—such as the velocity, magnetic field, and temperature—as well as the turbulent energy density, cross helicity, and correlation scale. These computed quantities provide the basis for evaluating additional useful parameters that are derivable from the primary model outputs. Here we illustrate one such possibility in which computed turbulence and large-scale parameters are used to evaluate the accuracy of the Taylor “frozen-in” hypothesis along the PSP trajectory. Apart from the immediate purpose of anticipating turbulence conditions that PSP will encounter, as experience is gained in comparisons of observations with simulated data, this approach will be increasingly useful for planning and interpretation of subsequent observations.},

Based on this solution of the Euler equations, an exact explicit and closed description for any single- and multi-point characteristics of turbulence in a compressible medium are obtained, and Onsager’s dissipative anomaly is considered. The exact turbulence energy universal spectrum EðkÞ / kÀ8=3, corresponding to the time t ! t0 of the shock arising, is stated. That spectrum is more relevant to the strong acoustic turbulence than the well-known spectrum EðkÞ / kÀ2.

	abstract = {It is shown that when the electron temperature Te is of the same order of the proton temperature parallel to the background magnetic field, the growth rate of the proton mirror mode in the long-wavelength limit is reduced by the presence of a longitudinal electric field. The field is due to the electron pressure gradient which builds up when Te ≠ 0, because the electrons are dragged by nonresonant protons which are mirror accelerated from regions of high into regions of low parallel magnetic field flux. In return, the longitudinal electric field causes the density of nonresonant protons with a perpendicular velocity smaller than a strongly Te-dependent critical velocity υ⊥,crit to increase (decrease) at maxima (minima) of the parallel magnetic field flux. These nonresonant protons thus behave differently from the “circulating” protons described by Southwood and Kivelson (1993) in the cold electron limit. Although the instability threshold is only weakly affected by changes in Te, quantities like the growth rate, the compressibility, the polarization, and the angle between wave vector and magnetic field for the most unstable mode, as well as the structure of the perturbed proton distribution itself, are strongly modified by variations in the electron temperature. The predictions of the model are shown to agree well with numerical solutions of the full Vlasov dispersion relation, indicating that most long-wavelength aspects of the proton mirror instability are included in the model.},

	abstract = {This Letter exploits joint observations of the same interplanetary coronal mass ejection by widely separated spacecraft to study, for the ﬁrst time, the turbulent evolution of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) properties of the embedded magnetic cloud, during its propagation throughout interplanetary space. Speciﬁcally, the event was observed by Wind at 1 au on 1998 March 4–6 and tracked to the location of Ulysses at 5.4 au 18 days later, when the two spacecraft were radially aligned with the Sun. The analysis of the MHD invariants within the magnetic cloud, along with its energy budget, provides compelling evidence of magnetic erosion of the structure thanks to its interaction with a trailing magnetic cloud. The helical conﬁguration is thus largely deformed and degraded, and the initial dominance of magnetic over kinetic energy is observed to evolve toward a less imbalanced condition. This is consistent with the expected conversion of magnetic energy into kinetic energy due to magnetic reconnection processes. Local interaction of the magnetic cloud’s (MC) outer layers with the solar wind acts to generate larger amplitude Alfvénic ﬂuctuations in the downstream region, leading the MC to turbulently evolve toward a more complex cross-helicity conﬁguration in the outer heliosphere. Finally, evidence of a ﬂux rope locally generated by magnetic reconnection events at 1 au that likely decays by the time it reaches Ulysses is also reported.},

The focus is on properties of the fluctuations in the frequency domain. Eulerian frequency spectra and individual wave number mode frequency spectra show the presence of peaks at the corresponding Alfvén wave frequencies for full nonlinear simulations in a turbulent regime. The peaks are however broad and their power content is compared to the power in the full spectrum as well as a signal to noise ratio is defined and quantified for different values of the background magnetic field. The ratio of power in Alfvén waves to the power in the rest of the spectrum is also quantified and is found to be small for different values of the mean magnetic field. Individual modes in time show a much more complex behavior than that could be expected for linear solutions. Also, nonlinear transfer of energy is evidenced by the existence of peaks at wave numbers perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Implications are discussed for theories of strong turbulence as well as perturbation theories that assume the leading order behavior is that of propagating Alfvén waves.},

	abstract = {L'objectif de cette thèse est une comparaison des données de simulations numériques directes (DNS) d'un écoulement turbulent isotrope homogène en trois dimensions avec des prédictions analytiques récentes obtenues au moyen de l'approche du groupe de renormalisation fonctionnel (FRG). Les principaux résultats de la thèse concernent la fonction de corrélation spatio-temporelle de la vitesse, qui devrait décroître comme une fonction gaussienne du temps aux petits décalages et exponentiellement aux grands décalages temporels. Les résultats numériques montrent que la fonction de corrélation à deux points des modes de Fourier de vitesse décroît effectivement comme une gaussienne dans le temps aux petits décalages temporels. Le même comportement est observé pour les corrélations triples de la vitesse, qui peuvent être liées à la fonction de transfert d'énergie spectrale. Cependant, le comportement aux grands décalages temporels est indiscernable en raison des amplitudes faibles des fonctions de corrélation.Un autre résultat important de la thèse concerne les corrélations spatio-temporelles dans la turbulence du scalaire passif. Les simulations d’une quantité scalaire dans un champ de vitesse gouverné pas l’équation de Navier-Stokes démontrent également une décroissance gaussienne pour la fonction de corrélation du scalaire à de petits décalages, similaire à la corrélation de vitesse. L'influence des corrélations temporelles de vitesse sur le scalaire est étudiée dans des simulations avec des champs de vitesse synthétiques. Dans le cas d'une vitesse aléatoire delta-corrélée en temps (également connue sous le nom de modèle de Kraichnan), les corrélations du scalaire démontrent une décroissance purement exponentielle dans le temps. L'ajout d'un temps de corrélation fini à la vitesse synthétique conduit à l'émergence d'une partie de la décroissance gaussienne à de petits décalages temporels dans la fonction de corrélation scalaire, tandis qu'elle devient exponentielle à des décalages temporels plus grands que le temps de corrélation de vitesse typique. Ces résultats révèlent la transition entre les deux régimes de corrélation temporelle, comme prédit par le FRG.La dernière partie de la thèse présente une étude préliminaire du modèle en couches de l'advection aléatoire du scalaire passif avec l'utilisation de l'approche FRG. La lois d'échelle normale dans la fonction de structure de second ordre du scalaire est obtenue, et les directions possibles d’études des lois d'échelle anormales sont discutées.},

	abstract = {Empirically derived kappa distributions are becoming increasingly widespread in space physics as the power law nature of various suprathermal tails is melded with more classical quasi-Maxwellian cores. Two different mathematical definitions of kappa distributions are commonly used and various authors characterize the power law nature of suprathermal tails in different ways. In this study we examine how kappa distributions arise naturally from Tsallis statistical mechanics, which provides a solid theoretical basis for describing and analyzing complex systems out of equilibrium. This analysis exposes the possible values of kappa, which are strictly limited to certain ranges. We also develop the concept of temperature out of equilibrium, which differs significantly from the classical equilibrium temperature. This analysis clarifies which of the kappa distributions has primacy and, using this distribution, the kinetic and physical temperatures become one, both in and out of equilibrium. Finally, we extract the general relation between both types of kappa distributions and the spectral indices commonly used to parameterize space plasmas. With this relation, it is straightforward to compare both spectral indices from various space physics observations, models, and theoretical studies that use kappa distributions on a consistent footing that minimizes the chances for misinterpretation and error. Now that the connection is complete between empirically derived kappa distributions and Tsallis statistical mechanics, the full strength and capability of Tsallis statistical tools are available to the space physics community for analyzing and understanding the kappa-like properties of the various particle and energy distributions observed in space.},

Here we briefly revisit the CGL description and discuss its (otherwise well-documented) linear firehose and mirror instability thresholds; namely that the firehose instability threshold is identical to the one found from linear kinetic theory and that the mirror threshold contains a factor of 6 error. We consider a simple higher-order fluid model with time dependent heat flux equations and show that the mirror instability threshold is correctly reproduced. We also present fully nonlinear three-dimensional simulations of freely decaying turbulence for the Hall-CGL model with isothermal electrons. The spatial resolution of these simulations is 5123 and the formation of a spectral break in magnetic and velocity field spectra around the proton inertial length is found.},

	abstract = {The origin and evolution of the 1/f power law observed in the energy spectrum of solar coronal and solar wind fluctuations at scales of around an hour is not entirely understood. Several existing theories aim at explaining it, involving both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. An often overlooked property of the solar corona and solar wind is their highly inhomogeneous nature. In this paper we investigate the linear evolution of pure Alfvén and surface Alfvén waves propagating through a plasma that is inhomogeneous across the magnetic field. The inhomogeneity is given by density, which we model to be 2D colored noise, with power spectral slopes ranging from −2 to −1. Alfvén waves propagate independently on individual magnetic field lines, and eventually get completely out of phase through the process of phase mixing, leading to unrealistic spectra. When the coupling between the inhomogeneous background and the propagating waves is fully accounted for, transverse waves such as surface Alfvén waves (also referred to as kink or Alfvénic) appear, showing collective wave behavior of neighboring magnetic field lines with different Alfvén speeds. We show that the linear cascade of surface Alfvén wave energy, induced by phase mixing and resonant absorption, leads to a perpendicular wave energy spectrum, which tends to the perpendicular power spectrum of the background density. Based on our model, we propose that a perpendicular density power spectrum of 1/f in the solar corona can induce, through linear processes, the 1/f spectrum of the fluctuations that is observed at the largest scales.},

	abstract = {A model of anisotropic magnetogasdynamic turbulence is developed in order to investigate quantitatively a turbulent fluid origin for the small spatial scale density fluctuations observed in 1981 by Armstrong, Cordes, and Rickett in the interstellar medium. The anisotropy at these small spatial scales is not a free parameter, but results from the presence of a large-scale approximately uniform magnetic field that is a sum of the steadystate galactic magnetic field and the large-scale turbulent magnetic field fluctuations. The observed density fluctuations are interpreted to be two-dimensional isobaric entropy variations with oppositely directed gradients in temperature and density projected transverse to the local approximately uniform magnetic field. The observed distribution of the electron density variations is produced by the convection and distortion of these dynamically passive entropy fluctuations by the turbulent velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. In this work I investigate the nature of small-scale turbulent velocity and magnetic field variations that drive the density variations in the presence of a strong local magnetic field. Developing a model based on a significant new (1982) study of Montgomery, it is found that the small-scale turbulent velocity and magnetic fluctuations are distributed anisotropically and are concentrated transverse to the local magnetic field. In these directions transverse to the local field, transport coefficients are dramatically decreased compared to the transport coefficients found in the absence of magnetic fields. The energy-conserving inertial ranges of the modeled anisotropic flows, whose structures at small spatial scales are controlled by viscous damping, extend to significantly smaller spatial scales than the inertial ranges of isotropic turbulent flows. Thus, the power required to maintain an inertial range to small spatial scales is dramatically decreased by the use of these models of anisotropic turbulence. In order to quantify the properties of the modeled turbulent flows, three possible sites—cloud shell H ii regions, diffuse H n regions produced by O stars, and the tenuous intercloud medium—were investigated as possible locations for turbulent flows. It is shown in the H n sites that the energy-conserving inertial ranges of the modeled flows can extend to dimensions of an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest spatial scale observed by Armstrong, Cordes, and Rickett. The convection and distortion of entropy fluctuations and the possible contribution of magnetoacoustic waves are addressed in future works.},

	abstract = {We describe a new theoretical and numerical framework for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with an incorporated anisotropic pressure tensor, which can play an important role in collisionless plasmas. The classical approach to handle the anisotropy is based on application of the double adiabatic approximation, assuming that the pressure tensor is well described only by those components that are oriented parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field. This gyrotropic assumption, however, fails around magnetically neutral regions, where the cyclotron period may become comparable to or even longer than the system's dynamical time, which causes a singularity in the mathematical expression. In this paper, we demonstrate that this singularity can be completely removed by direct use of the 2nd-moment of the Vlasov equation, combined with an ingenious gyrotropization model. Numerical tests are used to verify that our model properly reduces to the standard MHD results or the double adiabatic formulation in an asymptotic manner under the limit of fast isotropization and fast gyrotropization, respectively.},

	abstract = {Turbulence simulations play a key role in advancing the general understanding of the physical properties of turbulence and in interpreting astrophysical observations of turbulent plasmas. For the sake of simplicity, however, turbulence simulations are often conducted in the isothermal limit. Given that the majority of astrophysical systems are not governed by isothermal dynamics, we aim to quantify the impact of thermodynamics on the physics of turbulence, through varying adiabatic index, γ, combined with a range of optically thin cooling functions. In this paper, we present a suite of ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations of thermally balanced stationary turbulence in the subsonic, super-Alfvénic, high (ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure) regime, where turbulent dissipation is balanced by two idealized cooling functions (approximating linear cooling and free–free emission) and examine the impact of the equation of state by considering cases that correspond to isothermal, monatomic, and diatomic gases. We find a strong anticorrelation between thermal and magnetic pressure independent of thermodynamics, whereas the strong anticorrelation between density and magnetic field found in the isothermal case weakens with increasing γ. Similarly, the linear relation between variations in density and thermal pressure with sonic Mach number becomes steeper with increasing γ. This suggests that there exists a degeneracy in these relations with respect to thermodynamics and Mach number in this regime, which is dominated by slow magnetosonic modes. These results have implications for attempts to infer (e.g.,) Mach numbers from (e.g.,) Faraday rotation measurements, without additional information regarding the thermodynamics of the plasma. However, our results suggest that this degeneracy can be broken by utilizing higher-order moments of observable distribution functions.},

The collisionless magnetohydrodynamic equations derived account for the pressure anisotropy that leads, in speciﬁc conditions, to the ﬁrehose and mirror instabilities. We study the time evolution of seed ﬁelds in turbulence under the inﬂuence of such instabilities. An approximate analytical time evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld is provided. The numerical simulations and the analytical predictions are compared. We found that (i) ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld was efﬁcient in ﬁrehose-unstable turbulent regimes, but not in the mirrorunstable models;(ii) the growth rate of the magnetic energy density is much faster than the turbulent dynamo;and (iii) the efﬁcient ampliﬁcation occurs at small scales. The analytical prediction for the correlation between the growth timescales and pressure anisotropy is conﬁrmed by the numerical simulations. These results reinforce the idea that pressure anisotropies—driven naturally in a turbulent collisionless medium, e.g., the intergalactic medium, could efﬁciently amplify the magnetic ﬁeld in the early universe (post-recombination era), previous to the collapse of the ﬁrst large-scale gravitational structures. This mechanism, though fast for the small-scale ﬁelds (∼kpc scales), is unable to provide relatively strong magnetic ﬁelds at large scales. Other mechanisms that were not accounted forhere (e.g., collisional turbulence once instabilities are quenched, velocity shear, or gravitationally induced inﬂows of gas into galaxies and clusters) could operate afterwardto build up large-scale coherent ﬁeld structures in the long time evolution.},

	abstract = {Advanced forecasting of space weather requires simulation of the whole Sun-to-Earth system, which necessitates driving magnetospheric models with the outputs from solar wind models. This presents a fundamental diﬃculty, as the magnetosphere is sensitive to both large-scale solar wind structures, which can be captured by solar wind models, and small-scale solar wind “noise,” which is far below typical solar wind model resolution and results primarily from stochastic processes. Following similar approaches in terrestrial climate modeling, we propose statistical “downscaling” of solar wind model results prior to their use as input to a magnetospheric model. As magnetospheric response can be highly nonlinear, this is preferable to downscaling the results of magnetospheric modeling. To demonstrate the beneﬁt of this approach, we ﬁrst approximate solar wind model output by smoothing solar wind observations with an 8 h ﬁlter, then add small-scale structure back in through the addition of random noise with the observed spectral characteristics. Here we use a very simple parameterization of noise based upon the observed probability distribution functions of solar wind parameters, but more sophisticated methods will be developed in the future. An ensemble of results from the simple downscaling scheme are tested using a model-independent method and shown to add value to the magnetospheric forecast, both improving the best estimate and quantifying the uncertainty. We suggest a number of features desirable in an operational solar wind downscaling scheme.},

After showing that these equations differ from the widely used double-adiabatic, or CGL, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we derive their correct expressions by resorting to the Vlasov equation. We thus obtain a dispersion relation, which is no longer strictly MHD: in addition to the three standard (fast, slow, and Alfvén) modes from double-adiabatic MHD theory, our dispersion relation also contains the mirror mode from kinetic theory. We examine the physical characteristics and stability properties of each of these four modes and provide numerical solutions for their frequency and growth/decay rate, both for simple proton–electron plasmas and for multispecies plasmas.},

The filtered compressible MHD formulae show transfer of kinetic and magnetic energies from large to small scales, as well as energy conversion between kinetic, magnetic, and thermal energies. The anisotropic filtering enables separate analyses of the energy flows perpendicular and parallel to the global mean magnetic field. Anisotropy in energy cascade is demonstrated by the larger perpendicular energy cascade rate and also the larger perpendicular wavenumbers associated with the peak energy transfer rate. We also find that the “inertial range” along the parallel (perpendicular) direction in the anisotropic energy cascade formulation is no longer strictly dissipation-free, because it includes the dissipation in the perpendicular (parallel) direction. A change in the driving force (kinetic only versus kinetic and magnetic) affects the energy conversion between kinetic and magnetic energies. While the compressibility of the driving force changes the partition of different channels of energy transfer and conversion, and also increases the total energy transfer rate, the global energy flow remains unaffected by compressibility qualitatively. Our analysis can be applied to multispacecraft observations of turbulence in the solar wind or a planetary magnetosphere.},

Spectral indices and flatness scaling exponents of magnetic field, velocity, and proton density measurements were obtained, and provided a standard description of the characteristics of turbulence within different sub-regions of the ICME and its surroundings. This analysis was followed by the validation of the third-order moment scaling law for isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence in the same sub-regions, which confirmed the fully developed nature of turbulence in the ICME plasma. The energy transfer rate was also estimated in each ICME sub-region and in the surrounding solar wind. An exceptionally high value was found within the ICME sheath, accompanied by enhanced intermittency, possibly related to the powerful energy injection associated with the arrival of the ICME.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03425v1},
	abstract = {The role of interchange reconnection as a drive mechanism for the solar wind is explored by solving the global magnetic-field-aligned equations describing wind acceleration. Boundary conditions in the low corona, including a reconnection-driven Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic outflow and associated heating differ from previous models. Additional heating of the corona associated with Alfv{\textbackslash}'en waves or other MHD turbulence, which has been the foundation of many earlier models, is neglected. For this simplified model a sufficient condition for interchange reconnection to overcome gravity to drive the wind is derived. The combination of Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic ejection and reconnection-driven heating yields a minimum value of the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en speed of the order of 350-400\$km/s\$ that is required to drive the wind. Recent evidence based on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations suggests that this threshold is typically exceeded in the coronal holes that are the source regions of the fast wind. On the other hand, since reconnection in the coronal environment is predicted to have a bursty character, the magnitude of reconnection outflows can be highly variable. The consequence is a highly non-uniform wind in which in some regions the velocity increases sharply to super-Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic values while in adjacent regions the formation of an asymptotic wind fails. A simple model is constructed to describe the turbulent mixing of these highly-sheared super-Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic flows that suggests these flows are the free-energy source of the Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence and associated switchbacks that have been documented in the PSP data in the near coronal environment. The global wind profiles are presented and benchmarked with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations at 12 solar radii.},

Plasma turbulence is primarily shaped by the forcing on large scales and damping on small scales. Based on an improved compressible MHD decomposition algorithm, our observations demonstrate that CD enhances the anisotropy of compressible MHD modes due to their strong pitch angle dependence. The wavenumber distributions of slow modes are more stretched perpendicular to the background magnetic field (\${\textbackslash}mathbf\{B\_0\}\$) under CD modulation compared to Alfv{\textbackslash}'en modes. In contrast, fast modes are subject to a more significant CD modulation. Fast modes exhibit a scale-independent, slight anisotropy above the CD truncation scales, and their anisotropy increases as the wavenumbers fall below the CD truncation scales. As a result, CD affects the relative energy fractions in total compressible modes. Our findings take a significant step forward in comprehending the functions of CD in truncating the compressible MHD turbulence cascade and the consequential energy anisotropy in the wavevector space.},

Assessment of the accuracy and feasibility of such third-order (or Yaglom) relations is most effectively accomplished by examining the von Kármán–Howarth equation in increment form, a framework from which the third-order laws are derived as asymptotic approximations. Using this approach, we examine the context of third-order laws for incompressible MHD in some detail. The simplest versions rely on the assumption of isotropy and the presence of a well-defined inertial range, while related procedures generalize the same idea to arbitrary rotational symmetries. Conditions for obtaining correct and accurate values of the dissipation rate from these laws based on several sampling and fitting strategies are investigated using results from simulations.

However, the observed magnetic fluctuations contain not only turbulence but also magnetic structures, leading to the violation of time stationarity. This violation would conceal the true scaling and influence the determination of the sampling angle with respect to the local background magnetic field. Here, to investigate scaling anisotropy, we utilize a simple but effective criterion ϕ {\textless} 10° to ensure the time stationarity of the magnetic field, where ϕ is the angle between the two averaged magnetic fields after cutting the interval into two halves. We study the scaling anisotropy using higher-order statistics of structure functions under the condition of stationarity for near-Sun solar wind turbulence for the first time based on measurements obtained from the Parker Solar Probe at 0.17 au. We find that the scaling indices ξ of the magnetic field show a linear dependence on the order p close to ξ(p) = p/4. The multifractal scaling of the magnetic-trace structure functions becomes monoscaling close to ξ(p) = p/3 with the local magnetic field perpendicular to the sampling direction and close to ξ(p) = p/4 with the local magnetic field parallel to the sampling direction when measured with the stationary background magnetic field. The scaling of the velocity-trace structure functions has similar but less significant changes. The near-Sun solar wind turbulence displays different scaling anisotropies from the near-Earth solar wind turbulence, suggesting the evolution of the nonlinear interaction process during solar wind expansion.},

	abstract = {An analytical theory of wave turbulence is developed for pure compressible magnetohydrodynamics in the small 𝛽β{\textbackslash}beta limit. In contrast to previous works where the multiple scale method was not mentioned and slow magneto-acoustic waves were included, we present here a theory for fast magneto-acoustic waves for which only an asymptotic closure is possible in three dimensions. We introduce the compressible Elsässer fields (canonical variables) and show their linear relationship with the mass density and the compressible velocity. The kinetic equations of wave turbulence for three-wave interactions are obtained and the detailed conservation is shown for the two invariants, energy and momentum (cross-helicity). An exact stationary solution (Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum) exists only for the energy. We find a 𝑘−3/2k−3/2k{\textasciicircum}\{-3/2\} energy spectrum compatible with the Iroshnikov–Kraichnan (IK) phenomenological prediction; this leads to a mass density spectrum with the same scaling. Despite the presence of a relatively strong uniform magnetic field, this turbulence is characterized by an energy spectrum with a power index that is independent of the angular direction; its amplitude, however, shows an angular dependence. We prove the existence of the IK solution using the locality condition, show that the energy flux is positive and hence the cascade direct and find the Kolmogorov constant. This theory offers a plausible explanation for recent observations in the solar wind at small 𝛽β{\textbackslash}beta where isotropic spectra with a −3/2−3/2-3/2 power-law index are found and associated with fast magneto-acoustic waves. This theory may also be used to explain the IK spectrum often observed near the Sun. Besides, it provides a rigorous theoretical basis for the well-known phenomenological IK spectrum, which coincides with the Zakharov–Sagdeev spectrum for acoustic wave turbulence.},

Here, we neglect dissipation because we are primarily concerned with behavior at the largest scale which has been shown to be essentially the same for ideal and real (forced and dissipative) MHD turbulence. A Fourier spectral transform method is used to numerically integrate the dynamical equations forward in time and results from six computer runs are presented with various combinations of imposed rotation and mean magnetic field. There are five separate cases of ideal, homogeneous, incompressible, MHD turbulence: Case I, with no rotation or mean field; Case II, where only rotation is imposed; Case III, which has only a mean magnetic field; Case IV, where rotation vector and mean magnetic field direction are aligned; and Case V, which has nonaligned rotation vector and mean field directions. Dynamic coefficients are predicted by statistical mechanics to be zero-mean random variables, but largest-scale coherent magnetic structures emerge in all cases during transition; this implies dynamo action is inherent in ideal MHD turbulence. These coherent structures are expected to occur in Cases I, II and IV, but not in Cases III and V; future studies will determine whether they persist.},

A principal based on vanishing nonlinear transfer is proposed to develop a unified theory of the turbulent relaxation of neutral fluids and plasmas. Unlike previous studies, the proposed principle enables us to find the relaxed states unambiguously without going through any variational principle. The general relaxed states obtained herein are found to support naturally a pressure gradient which is consistent with several numerical studies. Relaxed states are reduced to Beltrami-type aligned states where the pressure gradient is negligibly small. According to the present theory, the relaxed states are attained in order to maximize a fluid entropy S calculated from the principles of statistical mechanics [Carnevale et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 14, 1701 (1981)]. This method can be extended to find the relaxed states for more complex flows.},

However, the nature of these structures is still under debate and how they affect the higher-order scaling behavior in the near-Sun solar wind turbulence remains to be investigated. Here we use the magnetic field data measured by Parker Solar Probe in the near-Sun solar wind. We identify the intermittency by partial variance of increments method and conduct the multiorder structure functions analyses in the intermittency domain before and after removing the intermittency. We also perform for the first time the scaling analyses on the fluctuations of magnetic field direction given by the rotational angle , in which B 1 and B 2 are the magnetic fields measured at two instants. We find that the multifractal scaling of the magnetic field could be predicted by the log-Poisson intermittency model with 2D sheetlike structures and a simple Kolmogorov −5/3 monoscaling recovers after the removal of the intermittency. We also find a similar behavior for the scalings of θ, suggesting that magnetic discontinuities are involved in the energy transfer process of solar wind turbulence.},

	abstract = {Isentropic processes in thermodynamics are fundamental to our understanding of numerous physical phenomena across different scientific and engineering fields. They provide a theoretical reference case for the evaluation of real thermodynamic processes and observations. Yet, as analytical relations for isentropic transformations in gas dynamics are limited to ideal gases, the inability to analytically describe isentropic processes for non-ideal gases is a fundamental shortcoming. This work presents generalised isentropic relations in thermodynamics based on the work by Kouremenos et al., where three isentropic exponents γPv, γTv and γPT are introduced to replace the ideal gas isentropic exponent γ to incorporate the departure from the non-ideal gas behaviour. The general applicability of the generalised isentropic relations is presented by exploring its connections to existing isentropic models for ideal gases and incompressible liquids. Generalised formulations for the speed of sound, the Bernoulli equation, compressible isentropic flow transformations, and isentropic work are presented thereafter, connecting previously disjoint theories for gases and liquids. Lastly, the generalised expressions are demonstrated for practical engineering examples, and their accuracy is discussed.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00468v1},
	abstract = {Pressure anisotropy can strongly influence the dynamics of weakly collisional, high-beta plasmas, but its effects are missed by standard magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Small changes to the magnetic-field strength generate large pressure-anisotropy forces, heating the plasma, driving instabilities, and rearranging flows, even on scales far above the particles' gyroscales where kinetic effects are traditionally considered most important. Here, we study the influence of pressure anisotropy on turbulent plasmas threaded by a mean magnetic field (Alfv{\textbackslash}'enic turbulence). Extending previous results that were concerned with Braginskii MHD, we consider a wide range of regimes and parameters using a simplified fluid model based on drift kinetics with heat fluxes calculated using a Landau-fluid closure. We show that viscous pressure-anisotropy heating dissipates between a quarter and half of the turbulent cascade power injected at large scales. This will in turn influence the plasma's thermodynamics by regulating energy partition between different dissipation channels (e.g., electron and ion heat). However, due to the pressure anisotropy's rapid dynamical feedback onto the flows that create it -- an effect we term `magneto-immutability' -- the viscous heating is confined to a narrow range of scales near the forcing scale, supporting a nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. Despite the simplified model, our results -- including the viscous heating rate, distributions, and turbulent spectra -- compare favourably to recent hybrid-kinetic simulations. This is promising for the more general use of extended-fluid (or even MHD) approaches to model weakly collisional plasmas such as the intracluster medium, hot accretion flows, and the solar wind.},

It turns out that magnetic holes do not result from direct nonlinear saturation of the mirror instability that rather leads to magnetic humps. Nevertheless, both above and below threshold, there exist stable solutions of the VM equations in the form of large-amplitude magnetic holes. Special attention is paid to the skewness of the magnetic fluctuations (that is negative for holes and positive for humps) and its dependency on the distance to threshold and the beta of the plasma. Furthermore, the long-time evolution of magnetic humps resulting from the mirror instability in an extended domain far enough from threshold may, when the beta of the plasma is not too large, eventually lead to the formation of magnetic holes.},

In this complex scenario, reconnection is spontaneous but locally driven by the fields, with the boundary conditions provided by the turbulence. Matching classical turbulence analysis with a generalized Sweet-Parker theory, the statistical features of these multiple-reconnection events have been identified. A discussion on the accuracy of our algorithms is provided, highlighting the necessity of adequate spatial resolution. Applications to the study of solar wind discontinuities are reviewed, comparing simulations to spacecraft observations. New results are shown, studying the time evolution of these local reconnection events. A preliminary study on the comparison between MHD and Hall MHD is reported.

Current sheets are detected using the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method which identiﬁes regions of strong intermittency. We ﬁnd that strong electron heating occurs in high PVI ({\textgreater}3) current sheets while no signiﬁcant heating occurs in low PVI cases ({\textless}3), indicating that the former are dominant for energy dissipation.

	abstract = {Observations of solar wind turbulence indicate the existence of multiscale pressure-balanced structures (PBSs) in the solar wind. In this work, we conduct a numerical simulation to investigate multiscale PBSs and in particular their formation in compressive magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. By the use of the higher-order Godunov code Athena, a driven compressible turbulence with an imposed uniform guide field is simulated. The simulation results show that both the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure exhibit a turbulent spectrum with a Kolmogorov-like power law, and that in many regions of the simulation domain they are anticorrelated. The computed wavelet cross-coherence spectra of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure, as well as their space series, indicate the existence of multiscale PBSs, with the small PBSs being embedded in the large ones. These multiscale PBSs are likely to be related to the highly oblique-propagating slow-mode waves, as the traced multiscale PBS is found to be traveling in a certain direction at a speed consistent with that predicted theoretically for a slow-mode wave propagating in the same direction.},

In addition, at scales at which kinetic effects take place, the magnetic spectrum follows a steeper power-law k−α shape given by a spectral index α{\textgreater}5/3. In a recent publication, a quasilinear model was used to study the evolution of ion temperatures in a collisionless plasma in which electromagnetic waves propagate along the background magnetic field, and it was found that the interaction between the plasma and a turbulent spectrum of ion-cyclotron waves may lead the plasma to states out of thermal equilibrium characterized by enhanced temperature anisotropies T⊥{\textgreater}T‖ and with a reduction in the parallel proton beta, which is consistent with space observations. Here, we complement such studies by analyzing the quasilinear interaction between plasma and a solar-wind-like turbulent spectrum of fast magnetosonic waves, and study the role of firehose instability (FHI) in the regulation of temperature anisotropy. Our results show that the presence of turbulence significantly modifies the FHI marginal stability threshold, as predicted from linear theory. Moreover, depending on the value of the plasma β, a turbulent magnetosonic spectrum may lead an initially thermally isotropic plasma to develop anisotropic states in which T⊥},

Our study covers both gas-pressure-dominated (high β) and magnetic-pressure-dominated (low β) plasmas at different Mach numbers. In addition, we present results for super-Alfvénic turbulence and discuss in what way it is similar to sub-Alfvénic turbulence. We describe a technique of separating different magnetohydrodynamic modes (slow, fast and Alfvén) and apply it to our simulations. We show that, for both high- and low-β cases, Alfvén and slow modes reveal a Kolmogorov k−5/3 spectrum and scale-dependent Goldreich–Sridhar anisotropy, while fast modes exhibit a k−3/2 spectrum and isotropy. We discuss the statistics of density fluctuations arising from MHD turbulence in different regimes. Our findings entail numerous astrophysical implications ranging from cosmic ray propagation to gamma ray bursts and star formation. In particular, we show that the rapid decay of turbulence reported by earlier researchers is not related to compressibility and mode coupling in MHD turbulence. In addition, we show that magnetic field enhancements and density enhancements are marginally correlated. Addressing the density structure of partially ionized interstellar gas on astronomical-unit scales, we show that the viscosity-damped regime of MHD turbulence that we reported earlier for incompressible flows persists for compressible turbulence and therefore may provide an explanation for these mysterious structures.},

The relevance of the present investigation to recent solar wind turbulence observations by Cluster is pointed out. In the present paper, two types of scaling, k−3.4 and k−3.6, are observed.

The characteristic temporal and spatial scales of the turbulence are comparable to those of the instability. Therefore, turbulence may violate the common assumption of a uniform and stationary background used to describe instabilities and make the properties of the instabilities different. To investigate this effect, we perform three-dimensional hybrid simulations with particle-in-cell ions and a quasi-neutralizing electron fluid. We find that the turbulence significantly reduces the growth rates and saturation levels of both instabilities. Comparing the cases with and without turbulence, the former results in a higher temperature anisotropy in the asymptotic marginally stable state at large times. In the former case, the distribution function averaged over the simulation box is also closer to the initial one.},

	abstract = {Numerous prior studies have shown that as proton beta increases, a narrower range of proton temperature anisotropy values is observed. This effect has often been ascribed to the actions of kinetic microinstabilities because the distribution of observational data aligns with contours of constant instability growth rates in the beta-anisotropy plane. However, the linear Vlasov theory of instabilities assumes a uniform background in which perturbations grow. The established success of linear-microinstability theories suggests that the conditions in regions of extreme temperature anisotropy may remain uniform for a long enough time so that the instabilities have the chance to grow to sufficient amplitude. Turbulence, on the other hand, is intrinsically nonuniform and nonlinear. Thin current sheets and other coherent structures generated in a turbulent plasma may quickly destroy the uniformity. It is, therefore, not a-priori obvious whether the presence of intermittency and coherent structures favors or disfavors instabilities. To address this question, we examined the statistical distribution of growth rates associated with proton temperature-anisotropy driven microinstabilities and local nonlinear time scales in turbulent plasmas. Linear growth rates are, on average, substantially less than the local nonlinear rates. However, at the regions of extreme values of temperature anisotropy, near the “edges” of the populated part of the proton temperature anisotropy-parallel beta plane, the instability growth rates are comparable or faster than the turbulence time scales. These results provide a possible answer to the question as to why the linear theory appears to work in limiting plasma excursions in anisotropy and plasma beta.},

	abstract = {The Elsässer variables are often used in studies of plasma turbulence, in helping differentiate between MHD waves propagating parallel or antiparallel to the main magnetic field. While for pure Alfvén waves in a homogeneous plasma the method is strictly valid, we show that compressible, magnetoacoustic waves are in general described by both Elsässer variables. Furthermore, in a compressible and inhomogeneous plasma, the pure MHD waves (Alfvén, fast and slow) are no longer normal modes, but waves become linearly coupled or display mixed properties of Alfvén and magnetoacoustic nature. These waves are necessarily described by both Elsässer variables, and therefore the Elsässer formalism cannot be used to strictly separate parallel and antiparallel propagating waves. Nevertheless, even in an inhomogeneous plasma, for a highly Alfvénic wave the Elsässer variable corresponding to the propagation direction appears still dominating. We suggest that for Alfvénic waves, the relative amplitude of Elsässer variables depends on the local degree of inhomogeneity and other plasma and wave properties. This finding has implications for turbulence studies in inhomogeneous and compressible plasmas, such as the solar corona and solar wind.},
